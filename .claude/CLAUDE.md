# mp_gunfight — Black Ops Gunfight for Plutonium T5 (Black Ops 1 MP)

A standalone **Gunfight** gametype (`gf`) for Call of Duty: Black Ops 1 on Plutonium T5. Two teams,
a **shared loadout that rotates every other round**, one life per round, no killstreaks/regen/drops.
Time expires → most-remaining-health wins the round (or capture the overtime flag). First to **6 round
wins** takes the match.

### Open bugs
- **Clients still print `MAX_PACKET_USERCMDS` during the round-end killcam.** Cosmetic only — **the server
  is healthy and the game plays great; this is NOT a regression and NOT urgent.** 🛑 **The one hard
  constraint: do NOT chase it by lowering `scr_gf_killcam_slowmo` below 0.6 or raising `sv_fps`.** Both
  "fix" the spam by breaking something real (the plug comes back / the killcam archive truncates), and the
  live server is currently *correct*. The 0.6 floor already cut the server's game-frame gap from ~185ms to
  ~80ms and **killed the "Connection Interrupted" plug**, which was the symptom that mattered. The spam is
  a *different, tighter* client limit: `MAX_PACKET_USERCMDS` (32) is the **per-packet** cap, and exceeding
  it merely truncates the oldest queued commands (the server still gets the newest and keeps acking) —
  whereas the plug is `CG_DrawDisconnect`'s much looser backlog threshold. **Unknown:** why 32 is still
  exceeded at an ~80ms gap. Our model says a client would need >~400 fps; either the count is not
  "commands since the last ack" (more likely it is commands since the last *sent packet*, i.e. driven by
  `cl_maxpackets`, which would make it largely a client-side matter), or `com_maxfps` is higher than
  assumed. **Cheap next probe, zero server risk: have one client set `cl_maxpackets 100` (and/or
  `com_maxfps 125`) and see if the spam stops.** That single read tells us which limit we are actually
  hitting, and it costs nothing to try. ⚠ Do not touch the server to test this.
  ([[killcam-slowmo-timescale-usercmd-backlog]])
- **Which client orphans `.killcam` in the round-end deadlock is still unproven.** The deadlock itself is
  now broken by `gf_postRoundWatchdog` (the infinite round can't recur), but the *leaker* was never pinned:
  `finalKillcam`'s only live endon is `self endon("disconnect")`, and a disconnected player leaves
  `level.players` — yet the observed hang persisted after the disconnector left again, so the leaker was a
  client that STAYED. Prime suspect is a fill bot added into the killcam window (`gf_boundaryListener` adds
  at `gf_round_over` +0.5s, and `startLastKillcam` snapshots `level.players` *after* `play_final_killcam`).
  **Next occurrence: read the `GF_ENDWATCH:` log line — it names the client and the flag.**
  ([[infinite-round-orphaned-killcam-flag]])
- **Pregame lobby can end on its own** (should end only via the load/min gate or an admin START) — only
  reachable when `scr_gf_lobby` is Auto/Manual (default Normal has no hold, so masked by default).
- **Prematch/intro countdown runs in slow-motion** — NOT transient and NOT a rendering artifact.
  `GF_HITCH` measures **game-time dilation** (`wait` counts game time, `gettime()` counts real time), so
  `750ms vs 500ms` means the whole simulation ran at ~65% speed for that window. The countdown is simply
  the last clock still driven by a game-time `wait(1.0)`; the mod's own clocks are gettime-anchored and
  immune. **Measured on the VPS (10 days, 2,803 hitches):** 99.3% land in `phase=prematch` — roughly one
  per round, ~700-750ms, and **flat across bot count** (694ms at 0 bots vs 746ms at 6), so it is the
  engine's `map_restart` itself, *not* our bots / HUD pushes / loadout giving. It is not ours to delete →
  **the fix is to make the countdown immune** (gettime-own it; see Ideas). Separately, 226 hitches exceed
  **2s** (map load + the `MatchRecord` stat flush), and **15 landed mid-gameplay** at ~2.8s — those are the
  ones that actually hurt, and the two suspects now have panel toggles: **`demo_enabled`** (match
  recording / the `democlient`; the killcam does **not** depend on it) and **`scr_allowbattlechatter`**
  (whose `CheckDistanceToEvent` the GSC VM has killed 3× with "potential infinite loop", each landing on a
  2.4-2.5s frame hitch). Ceiling: the box is 4 **shared** Contabo vCPUs — steal time produces multi-second
  stalls no config fixes. Instrumented via `gf_hitchMonitor` (`gf_hitch_pct`/`gf_hitch_debug`)
  ([[vps-prematch-slowmo-framehitch]]).
- **Mod may still change some client settings** — the r_* vis-tweak force-push was removed; confirm
  nothing else writes a saved client dvar.
- **Democlient round-cam lag.**
- **Start music is killed by the ambient map music.**
- **Minimap compass doesn't show wager (zoomed) size on some DLC maps** — inherent to the resident-art
  whitelist excluding First Strike/Escalation maps.
- **SECURITY:** rotate the leaked RCON password (VPS `dedicated.cfg`) + the exposed Plutonium server key.
- **Prevent a duplicate launcher from squatting port 28960 after a reboot** (root cause of the reported
  "FF/settings revert on restart").
- **`GF-Watchdog` misses a script-compile crash — the server can be DOWN while the task reads `Running`.**
  Observed live 2026-07-12: a GSC compile error → `SV_Shutdown`, the game exe gone, but the
  `GF-GameServer` scheduled task still reported `State: Running`, because the task's process is the
  `cmd.exe`/bat wrapper and *that* survives the game's exit. Nothing auto-recovered it; a manual
  Stop/Start-ScheduledTask (plus killing a stray `plutonium` launcher) was needed. **A watchdog that
  checks task state cannot see this class of death — it must check for the
  `plutonium-bootstrapper-win32` PROCESS** (and/or an rcon `status` reply), not the task.

> Known design caveat, not a bug: **large/small spawn mode takes effect one round after the HUD readout**
> (next-round snapshot vs live count — see *Team-size mode*).

### Ideas & future
- **Killfeed duration is CLIENT-ONLY — the server cannot force it (SETTLED on the VPS 2026-07-13).**
  The killfeed is the engine's **game-message window 0**, not a hudelem: `con_gameMsgWindow0Filter`
  carries the `"obituary"` type (window 1 = boldgame, window 2 = subtitles), and its on-screen time is
  **`con_gameMsgWindow0MsgTime`** — **seconds**, stock **5** (siblings: `LineCount` 4, `FadeInTime` 0.25,
  `FadeOutTime` 0.5, `ScrollTime` 0.25). A player retimes their own killfeed with
  `/con_gameMsgWindow0MsgTime 20` in their console — works today, no mod change, and it's `seta` so it
  persists. ⚠ **A server push is REFUSED**: the dvar is `con_*` (client-owned) *and* archived, the class
  Plutonium blocks ([[rcon-dedicated-dvar-push-limits]]). Proven on the dedicated VPS with a live human:
  the bridge dispatched (`gf_ack` advanced), `cg_thirdPerson` pushed in the same session **landed**
  (control), and the killfeed dvar **stayed at 5**. Dev verb `killfeed_<sec>` (`_gf_bridge.gsc`) exists
  and is kept only as the reproduction. **Remaining choice if we ever want to own the timing:** document
  the console line for players (cheap), or render our own killfeed in the menu layer (costs reliable
  commands per kill + a `mod.ff` rebuild). ⚠ **Never use an archived dvar as the control** in a push test —
  `cg_drawFPS` is itself `seta`, so `fps_1` fails under BOTH hypotheses and proves nothing (it wasted the
  first run of this experiment). ([[killfeed-duration-client-archived]])
- **Own the prematch/intro countdown with `gettime()`** so a hitch degrades to a 1-frame stutter (the
  planned fully-custom-timers branch). **This is the real fix for the slow-mo countdown** — see the
  frame-hitch bug above: the hitch itself is the engine's `map_restart` and is not ours to delete, but the
  countdown is the last clock still driven by game-time `wait(1.0)`, so owning it makes the symptom vanish.
  ⚠ Do **not** pair this with the once-floated **sv_fps 30** experiment: `GF_HITCH` is *game-time dilation*
  (wall time to advance 0.5s of game time), and the stall is a fixed lump of wall-clock work — more frames
  per second on a CPU-starved box buys more overhead and *more* dilation, not less. VPS runs 20; leave it.
- **Move the loadout slide-out into the menu layer** (kill the last GSC dvar-animation stream). `gf_slideLoadout`
  pushes 1 batched command per 0.05s step for 0.5s = **~13 reliable commands/human/round, forever** — halved
  from 26 by batching the off+alpha pair, but still the densest stream the mod emits, and the only one a
  batch can't take to zero ([[server-command-overflow-reliable-command-budget]]). The menu can
  animate for free: `milliseconds()` works in an `exp` (stock `after_action_report.menu` / `game_summary.menu`
  interpolate off `ui_time_marker` + `exec "setdvartotime"`). ⚠ **BLOCKED on one unverified fact:** the menu's
  only clock is **client-local**, so the start marker must be stamped **by the client** from a menu event
  (`onOpen` on a menuDef / `onEnter` on an itemDef) — the server **cannot** push a marker in its `gettime()`
  base. Our overview lives in an always-loaded `loadMenu`'d HUD menu with no obvious per-round event. **Settle
  it with one `mod.ff` rebuild:** render `milliseconds()` in a debug itemDef and compare against `gettime()`.
  If it tracks, it's server-synced `cg.time` and the server can stamp the marker directly (trivial). If it's
  client realtime, either find a per-round menu event or just snap the outro out (the intro is already a snap).
- **Hybrid custom round-timer HUD:** keep the native engine-driven `MM:SS` for the normal phase, own only
  the final ≤10s (orange `S.T` tenths) via the menu layer, route OT through the same element.
- **Mid-round late spawn / bot backfill** (designed ~25 lines, not built): let a client added mid-round
  spawn into a live round when its team still has ≥1 alive (double-blocked in OT).
- RCON: gas/stun/flash intensity sliders; mantle/climb speed control.
- Lobby ready-up / team-picking UI; lobby fly-cam controls.
- Min-players option that also counts bots (`scr_gf_min_players` counts humans only today).
- Spawn/flag pass: widen spawns; adjust flags generally; Hockey mode on Arena (map-specific).
- Ship custom weapon files for ADS-FOV / move-speed tuning; tuning pass (shorter round, capture 3.5s,
  Hardened on sniper classes).
- Persistent "gunfight.us" HUD text; general HUD/visual polish; rename the "democlient" bot label; rename
  the gametype display "GF" → "Gunfight".
- Site/branding: design pass; server ads; credit Plutonium/bots; show per-map feature support; on-brand
  Discord live-count card ([[discord-widget-csp-frame-src]]). Setup guide: recommend `cg_fov 65`,
  `cg_fovScale 1.4`. BO1 server "role" tied to Discord activity.

## Goal & design philosophy

**Bring an authentic Gunfight experience to T5 using as much native/core-engine and existing-library
functionality as possible.** The bar for writing custom code is: *does a stock system already express
this?* If yes, use it. We own only the few systems the engine genuinely cannot express, and we own
them for a specific, documented reason.

Principles, in priority order:
1. **Native-first.** Round cycling, scoring, intermission, killcam, prematch, `_gameobjects`, spawn
   selection, friendly-fire, and flinch are all stock. We hook them via `level.on*` callbacks, we do
   not reimplement them.
2. **Own only what stock can't do**, and say why in a comment: the retunable **round clock** (stock
   time-out thresholds are hardcoded absolute seconds, unusable on a 45s round), the **overtime clock**
   (needs pause/resume on a *gameplay condition* + hide-on-capture), and the **HUD** (the per-client
   render cap forces the menu layer).
3. **Strictly avoid poor-performance patterns.** No per-frame busy loops, no redundant polling, no
   piling `setClientDvar` bursts on one frame, no per-client HUD-render-cap abuse. Polling loops are
   bounded (`endon` a lifecycle notify), event-driven where possible, and coalesced.
4. **Lean on `game[]`/`self.pers[]` for anything that must survive `map_restart`** (see the map_restart
   rule below); re-derive everything else each round in `onStartGameType`.

We do **not** reference other community Gunfight mods — they are not a design source here. The only
external references we use are the official engine sources (see **Resources**).

## Working in this repo

**The repo IS the mod folder.** A clone of `main` drops into the Plutonium T5 storage tree at
`%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t5\mods\mp_gunfight\`, so testing is just `loadMod mp_gunfight` +
`map_restart` in the Plutonium console (`connect 127.0.0.1:28960` for a local dedicated server).

- **GSC is loaded as loose rawfiles** — edit a `.gsc` and `map_restart`; **no rebuild**. Only compiled
  assets need `mod.ff` (see *Building mod.ff*).
- **Local-test cfg quirks:** `party_minplayers 1` for solo testing (`2` for public). If ADS feels wrong
  locally, `exec autoexec`. (The `scr_xpscale is read only` error at boot is our own cfg line being
  rejected — see *XP* below; it is harmless but it is **not** a local-only quirk.)
- **Test panel/bridge/telemetry changes against a DEDICATED server, not a listen host** — a listen
  server masks RCON queue saturation and the "Unknown cmd" dvar-probe spam that only bite on the VPS.

## Core gameplay spec

- **Round-based, one life** — last team standing ends the round; then killcam. `scr_gf_numlives 1`.
- **Match = 6 round wins.** The real threshold is `scr_gf_scorelimit` (6), enforced by stock
  `hitScoreLimit()` on `game["teamScores"]` — each round win adds **1** to the winner's team score in
  `gf_endRound`. (`level.roundWinLimit`/`hitRoundWinLimit` are **inert** here — `RoundWinLimit` is
  registered at 0. To change match length, change `scr_gf_scorelimit`.)
- **Shared random loadout** — every player gets the same primary/secondary/lethal/tactical/equipment
  each round; the pool rotates every `scr_gf_roundsperloadout` (2) rounds.
- **No killstreaks, no health regen, no weapon drops, no class-select** — `level.killstreaksenabled=0`,
  `level.healthRegenDisabled=true`, `scr_disable_weapondrop 1`, `scr_disable_cac 1` (all re-forced each
  round in `onStartGameType`).
- **Round decided by time** → most total remaining HP wins; equal HP is a **draw** (draws add no score).
  If both teams are still alive at expiry, **overtime**: capture the overtime flag, else HP decides.
- **Damage-based scoring** — a player's score is the running total of damage they've dealt.
- **Loadout HUD** — on spawn, a create-a-class-style overview of the round's weapons + perks.

## How each system works today

*(Present-tense architecture. File refs are `_gf_rounds.gsc` unless noted. Deep detail →
`docs/REFERENCE.md`; incident depth → `[[memory]]`.)*

### The `map_restart` rule (read first)
SD round cycling calls `_globallogic::endGame` → **`map_restart(true)` between rounds**, which wipes
**all `level.*`** (and entities) but keeps `game[]` and `self.pers[]`. The pregame lobby uses
**`map_restart(false)`**, which wipes `game[]`/`pers[]`/`level[]` too. Consequences that shape the whole
codebase: `onStartGameType` re-runs every round and must re-establish every `level.*` value; anything
that must survive a restart lives in `game[]`, `pers[]`, or a **dvar** (dvars are the *only* thing
surviving `map_restart(false)`); and **threads survive both restarts** (only `game_ended` tears them
down), so persistent loops are collapsed to one copy via a re-init notify (`bot_reinit`,
`gf_bridge_reinit`) rather than a `game[]` once-guard.

### Round lifecycle & activation
`onStartGameType` stamps `level.gf_roundGen = gettime()` (monotonic across restarts) and resets round
flags. The round runs on the **engine's native prematch** (`level.prematchPeriod`): countdown, freeze,
intro VO, hint, timer-hide are all stock; the only addition is `gf_nativePrematchTicker()` (a 1 Hz beep
the silent stock countdown lacks). Activation is spawn-driven: `gf_onSpawned` threads
`gf_tryActivateRound`, which dedups (0.2s), `waittill("prematch_over")`, then in one **yield-free**
block sets `gf_roundActive`, threads `gf_roundWatchdog(myGen)`, closes grace early
(`gf_closeGraceEarly`, prematch_over+3s floor), captures the team-mode snapshot, and starts the round
clock. Staleness is handled by **capturing `myGen` and bailing if `gf_roundGen` moved** — never by an
`endon` on a lobby-reset notify (that once killed a committing activator and stranded the round;
[[round-freeze-activation-race-and-rails]]).

The round ends by three paths, all → `gf_endRound(winner)` → `_globallogic::endGame`:
elimination (`gf_onDeadEvent`), clock expiry (`gf_onTimeLimit` → HP decision or overtime), or OT
capture. `gf_endRound` adds 1 to the winner's team score (not for "tie"), sets the WIN/LOSS banner
subtitle (`gf_reasonText`), and starts the last killcam. `gf_roundWatchdog` is the only **in-round**
backstop (the mod suppresses every native fallback), gettime()-anchored, 1 Hz: it force-closes a stuck
grace after >65s and force-ends a round when a team has 0 alive out of grace for >3s.

**`gf_postRoundWatchdog` is the round-END half**, threaded from `gf_endRound` *before* `endGame`, because
`gf_roundWatchdog` carries `endon("gf_round_over")` and so retires exactly when the round-end hazard
opens. Stock's end sequence is **synchronous** (`endGame` → `startNextRound` → `displayRoundEnd` →
`executePostRoundEvents` → `map_restart(true)`) and two of its gates are unbounded: `finalKillcamWaiter()`
spins while **any** player merely has `.killcam` *defined*, and `roundEndWait()` spins while any player has
`.doingNotify` true. An orphaned flag on one client therefore blocks `map_restart` **forever** — and the
engine's own force-clear (`endedFinalKillcamCleanup`) waits on `game_ended`, which `endGame` already fired
*before* the final killcam starts, so it is **dead code on this path**. The watchdog is gen-token retired,
clears both flags after 20s, and logs which client/flag leaked (`GF_ENDWATCH:`)
([[infinite-round-orphaned-killcam-flag]]).

⚠ Never re-add an `endon` to the committing activator. ⚠ `gf_roundWatchdog` must stay.
⚠ `gf_postRoundWatchdog` must **not** carry `endon("game_ended")` (endGame fires it within a frame of the
thread starting) and must stay armed on the last round (the same waiter gates the match-end podium).

### Custom round clock & warnings
The live round timer is mod-owned because stock `timeLimitClock` fires its time-out sequence (announcer
VO, `TIME_OUT` music, beeps) at hardcoded absolute seconds — on a 45s round that fires almost
immediately and no dvar retunes it. `gf_startRoundClock` derives length from `level.timeLimit`
(per-mode), sets `level.timeLimitOverride=true` (own expiry), calls `pauseTimer()` (which sets
`level.timerStopped` and gates off the *entire* native warning loop), and drives the HUD via
`setGameEndTime`. `gf_roundClock` ticks 10 Hz off `gettime()` deltas (wall-clock, so sv_fps-immune).
Warning: one `leaderDialog("timesup")` at 15s + a beep each second in the final 10s. Starting the clock
before `prematch_over` would draw over the native countdown — so activation parks on `prematch_over`.
⚠ `pauseTimer()` freezes `getTimePassed()`, which breaks any stock system keyed off it — the grenade-dud
window is disabled (`grenadeLauncherDudTime`/`thrownGrenadeDudTime = -1`) for exactly this reason
([[paused-timer-freezes-gettimepassed]], [[gf-timer-prematch-and-pause-model]]).

### Final-killcam slow motion (`scr_gf_killcam_slowmo` = the timescale FLOOR)
Stock's round-end killcam drops the **whole server** to `SetTimeScale(0.25)` for the money shot
(`raw/_killcam.gsc::waitFinalKillcamSlowdown`, threaded per viewer from `finalKillcam()` — the
round-end cam only, never the per-death one). **Measured on the VPS: 0.27x, held for 8-10 REAL
seconds, every round.** That is what made the "Connection Interrupted" plug flash mid-replay, and it
is **one bug with the `MAX_PACKET_USERCMDS` console spam**, not two:

> The server retires a client's usercmds only when it runs a **game frame**, and
> **`game frames/sec = sv_fps × timescale`**. The game-time quantum is `1000/sv_fps` and a dilation
> does **not** shrink it — it spreads those quanta apart in **wall** time (at `sv_fps 20`, from 50ms
> to **~185ms**). A client makes one usercmd per client frame, so the queue is `com_maxfps × gap`;
> past `MAX_PACKET_USERCMDS` (**32**) it truncates its move packet, and the same backlog makes
> `CG_DrawDisconnect` draw the plug — **it fires when the server stops ACKING your commands, not when
> data stops arriving.** Stock 0.25 → 200ms gap. 0.6 → **~80ms gap, measured live**.

**SHIPPED AND CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-13): the plug is GONE and the game feels great in a full lobby.**
Sampler across 4 round-ends: the timescale floors at **0.62** (never below), frame gap **~80ms** — down
from 0.27 / ~185ms.

`gf_killcamSlowmoClamp` (threaded from `gf_endRound`) therefore clamps the slow-mo's **DEPTH, not its
length** — shortening it does nothing, the backlog builds within ~300ms of the drop. It anchors on
stock's `play_final_killcam` notify, mirrors stock's schedule, and re-asserts the floor at 10 Hz using
**stock's own `deathTime` ramp target**, so the cinematic keeps its shape and only its depth changes
(`SetTimeScale` is a plain builtin — the last caller wins). `gf_resetTimeScale()` in `onStartGameType`
is the unconditional net for a leaked dilation.
⚠ It bails unless `level.inFinalKillcam`: stock fires `play_final_killcam` **every** round, killcam or
not, so clamping unguarded would *slow down* a normal round end.
⚠ **`sv_fps` is NOT the lever**, though it is the other term: the killcam rewinds through an archived
snapshot ring sized in **frames, not seconds**, so raising it buys proportionally *less* killcam
history. Tried live at 80 — the replay ended early and the slow-mo never ran at all. **Leave it at 20.**
⚠ **No probe inside the GSC VM can see a dilation** — `SetTimeScale` doesn't mirror into a readable
`timescale` dvar, and `gettime()`/`wait()`/the log timestamps all share the *scaled* clock, so
`GF_HITCH`/`GF_ENDGAP` are blind to it (**their zeros were never an all-clear**). Measure it from
outside the sim with **`tools/ts_sample.ps1`** (RCON is the only wall clock we have).
🛑 **`MAX_PACKET_USERCMDS` STILL PRINTS, AND THAT IS NOT A REGRESSION — DO NOT "FIX" IT BY TOUCHING THE
FLOOR OR `sv_fps`.** An earlier version of this file called "zero `MAX_PACKET_USERCMDS`" the acceptance
test for the fix. **That was wrong** — it conflated two different client limits, and it is a trap: the
spam persists at floor 0.6 while the plug is gone, so a future session that treats the spam as failure
will "fix" a server that is working perfectly and reintroduce the plug. The two limits:
- **`MAX_PACKET_USERCMDS` (32)** — the *per-packet* cap. Exceeding it truncates the move packet, dropping
  the **oldest** queued commands. The server still gets your newest ones and keeps acking, so you lose a
  few ms of stale input nobody can feel. **Cosmetic. Console noise.**
- **`CG_DrawDisconnect`** — a *separate, much looser* backlog threshold. **This** is the plug, and this is
  what the 0.6 floor cleared.

The real acceptance test is the one that shipped: **the plug is gone and the game feels right.**
It remains an open item to make the spam stop too (see TODO) — but it is a **cosmetic-polish** task, and
the constraint is absolute: **do not regress the floor or raise `sv_fps` chasing it.**
([[killcam-slowmo-timescale-usercmd-backlog]])

### Overtime & the two-layer zone color system
`gf_onTimeLimit`: if both teams are alive at expiry → overtime (unless `scr_gf_overtimelimit <= 0`, then
HP decides immediately); else HP decides. Overtime is a custom ms-decrement clock (`gf_beginOvertime`/
`gf_overtimeClock`, gettime()-anchored) because the native timer cannot **pause/resume on a gameplay
condition** (freeze while the zone is being captured, resume if the capture breaks — via a pause-depth
counter), **hide during that pause** (`setGameEndTime(0)`), or tick per-second. The capture zone is
native `_gameobjects::createUseObject` on a **`trigger_radius`**, so standing in it accrues capture (no
button — which is also how bots win OT). A capture wins the round outright.

The color system is two layers with different meaning, dictated by an **engine constraint**:
- **Icons — team-relative** (2D minimap + 3D world), driven from the same native `_gameobjects` path
  (`set2DIcon`/`set3DIcon` + `setOwnerTeam`): **friendly → `defend` (green), enemy → `capture` (red)**,
  neutral/contested → white. (Reversing friendly→capture is the known "my team shows red" bug —
  [[overtime-icon-2d-3d-coincidence]].)
- **Apron ring FX — absolute** (white idle / gold capturing / red contested), the same for everyone,
  because a `spawnFx` entity renders in world space with **no per-team visibility** in T5. The apron
  physically *cannot* encode friendly/enemy — that's why the green/red lives only on the routed icons.

⚠ `loadfx` handles are `level.*`, wiped by `map_restart(true)` — so `gf_loadOvertimeApronFx()` re-loads
them **every OT entry**, not just at precache ([[onprecache-once-per-match-loadfx-wiped]]). ⚠ Native
objective IDs / objpoints accumulate across restarts, so per-round `gf_cleanupOvertimeZone` is mandatory
or the HUD pool exhausts. Deep detail → `docs/REFERENCE.md` "Overtime & capture zone".

### Match-start gate & pregame lobby
**One pre-prematch hold** (`gf_waitForLoadingClients`, called as the LAST statement of
`onStartGameType` — the engine threads the prematch only once that callback returns, so blocking there
= "prematch hasn't started"). It replaced two retired post-prematch gates. Loading clients connect while
still on the loading screen and aren't in `level.players` yet, so `gf_armLoadGate` collects them off the
level `"connecting"` notify (armed early, before the first yield); "loading" is read from `statusicon`.
Bots (`istestclient()`) and demo clients (`isdemoclient()`) are excluded. Three release conditions on
the one hold: **LOAD** (everyone off the loading screen, ceiling `scr_gf_load_wait`, 3s floor),
**MIN-PLAYERS** (`scr_gf_min_players` humans present; ceiling `scr_gf_minplayers_timer`, default 0 =
never auto-start; a 0-human lobby always releases), and **LOBBY MODE**.

`scr_gf_lobby`: **0 = Normal** (in-place hold, no restart), **1 = Auto** (release on load+min, then
fast-restart), **2 = Manual** (hold until an admin's START click, then fast-restart;
`scr_gf_lobby_timer` auto-start backstop, default 600s). The fast-restart is **`map_restart(false)`** —
the fresh reset that re-fires full match-start presentation (gun-rack, spawn music, welcome splash);
`map_restart(true)` deliberately suppresses that. The lobby branch **never returns** (`for(;;) wait 1;`
after the restart) so `startGame()` never threads a stale prematch that would survive and stack a double
countdown. The loop-break flag is the **`gf_matchArmed` dvar** (not `game[]`, which `false` wipes): set
before the restart, consumed after so the real match threads its clocks once. Lobby presentation:
desaturated `mpIntro` vision, bodyless overview cam, a custom `gf_lobby_hud` menuDef ("Waiting for
teams N/M"), forced autoassign. ([[gf-stuck-after-prematch-two-gates]])

**Lobby → match team transfer** survives the `false`-restart via dvars: `gf_writeTeamPlan`/
`gf_applyTeamPlan` carry humans by GUID (`gf_teamplan`); `gf_writeBotPlan`/`gf_applyBotPlan` carry bot
**counts** (`gf_botplan`, inert when `gf_fill_n > 0` — the reconciler owns bots then). `gf_applyTeamPlan`
must **yield before its first roster read** (it runs from the tail of `onStartGameType` where
`level.players` is empty). ⚠ A prematch team switch suicides an alive frozen player without restoring
`pers["lives"]`, so `maySpawn` then denies the respawn → "starts round 1 dead"; `gf_reseatRespawn`
restores the life and re-drives `spawnClient` ([[stock-teamswitch-suicide-no-life-restore]]).
`scr_gf_load_grace` (non-restart path) keeps round-1 grace open for a still-loading straggler.

### Pre-match warmup — `g_pregame_enabled` (100% stock, zero mod GSC)
BO1 ships a **pre-match lobby gametype**: a playable no-XP free-for-all on the map while the server
waits for players, which then hands itself off into the real match. It is fully native and we own
**none** of it — we only expose the switch in the RCON panel.

- **How the engine does it:** `BlackOpsMP.exe` carries the dvar **`g_pregame_enabled`** and the
  hardcoded script path `maps/mp/gametypes/_pregame`. When the dvar is set, the engine loads **that
  stock script instead of `<g_gametype>.gsc`** at level load. `g_gametype` still reads `gf` throughout,
  so `level.gameType`, the server browser and the panel all still say "gf". `_pregame::main()` sets
  `level.pregame = true` → `isPregame()` → stock `_globallogic` turns off XP/rank/AAR/leader-dialog and
  skips the prematch countdown. On release it calls the engine builtin **`pregamestartgame()`** (which
  latches `isPregameGameStarted()`, so a between-round `map_restart` does **not** re-enter the warmup)
  + `SetPreGameTeam`/`SetPregameClass` to carry players, then `map_restart(false)` into `gf`.
  ✅ Verified working on the Plutonium dedicated VPS — `set g_pregame_enabled 1` + `map_restart`.
- ⚠ **Read at LEVEL LOAD** → only ever affects the **next** map (same constraint as `xblive_wagermatch`).
  A `map_restart` is enough to trigger it. The panel badges it `NEXT MAP`. Seeded if-empty in
  `gf.gsc onStartGameType` purely so the panel's connect-sweep doesn't get "Unknown cmd".
- **Gate = `party_minplayers`** (NOT `scr_gf_min_players`). Snapshotted at level load, and it counts any
  non-spectator, so **bots count toward it**.
- ⚠ **`scr_pregame_timelimit` must be 0 — and the mod is what makes it so.** Stock `_pregame::main()`
  registers it via `registerTimeLimitDvar("pregame", 5, …)`, which is **seed-if-empty**, so an
  unregistered dvar lands on **5 minutes**; the warmup's `onTimeLimit` then calls
  `_globallogic::endGame`, and on *that* path it never reaches `pregamestartgame()` — the map
  **rotates** instead of starting the match, so an under-populated server just cycles maps every 5 min.
  `gf.gsc onStartGameType` therefore seeds it to `0` (strip-marked, next to the `g_pregame_enabled`
  seed): dvars outlive a map change, so our 0 is already in the table when the warmup loads and its
  seed-if-empty leaves it alone. `dedicated.cfg.example` sets it too, for the boot-straight-into-a-
  warmup case where that callback has never run.
- Known costs of staying stock (accept, or own with a documented reason): the warmup gives **stock
  classes**, not the Gunfight shared loadout; **no mod GSC runs during it**, so the RCON bridge is dead
  and `gf_state` goes stale (watch for `GF-Watchdog`'s `roundStuck` → `map_rotate` if a warmup with
  humans on it outlives `RoundStuckSecs` = 300s); and the `ui_gf_*` **client** dvars survive the map
  load, so a client that was last in a gf lobby renders the `gf_lobby_hud` menuDef *over* the warmup
  (stale "Waiting for the host to start" and all). That overlay is an accident, not a feature — it only
  appears for clients that saw a lobby earlier.

⚠ **Do NOT ship a mod `maps/mp/gametypes/_pregame.gsc`.** One was written and reverted (2026-07-12): the
native path already does the job, and overriding the stock script also means keeping its whole public
surface or the server won't compile — see the `unknown function` rule in the T5 cheatsheet below.

### Team-size mode (large vs small)
`level.gf_largeMode` (re-derived each round by `gf_resolveTeamMode`) is the single flag driving spawns,
the wager-blocker allow-list, the OT flag choice, and which `_large` dvar variant is read.
`scr_gf_teamspawnmode` = `auto` | `large` | `small`. **auto** is hard-wired to the health-panel skull cap
(`gf_hudSkullCap()`=4, mirroring the menu's `cnt > 4` gate): **≤4 per team → small** (curated clustered
wager-style spawns + skulls), **any team of 5+ → large** (full-map `mp_tdm_spawn` + `alive/total`
readout). It keys off the **larger** team (2v6 → large). Each mode reads its own dvar copy
(`_timelimit`/`_overtimelimit`/`gf_capture_time` + `_large`) so flipping never clobbers the other.

⚠ **Inherent one-round lag:** the spawn mode is a snapshot (`game["gf_autoLargeMode"]`, captured
post-prematch by `gf_updateAutoTeamMode`, applied *next* round) while the HUD readout is live — so a
roster crossing 4↔5 shows the readout one round before the spawns switch. By design (a live count inside
`onStartGameType` is unreliable — bots/late joiners connect after it), not a bug. ⚠ `gf_hudSkullCap()`
must stay in lockstep with the menu skull gate (rebuild-gated). Full detail → `docs/REFERENCE.md`.

### Loadout system
Shared random, **deterministic by round index** — every client reads the same
`int(game["roundsplayed"] / roundsPerLoadout) % poolSize`, so sync is by construction (no per-player
roll at give time). `gf_initLoadouts` builds a **53-entry** hand-authored pool once per match
(`game["gf_init"]` gate), Fisher-Yates shuffles it, stores it in `game["gf_pool"]`. Delivery is the
**`level.giveCustomLoadout = ::gf_giveCustomLoadout` hook** — stock `_class::giveLoadout` calls it during
the spawn's loadout build, so there's no `takeAllWeapons` overwrite race (`level.onGiveLoadout` does not
exist in T5). Base perks: Lightweight (+no-fall-damage), Marathon, Flak Jacket, flash/stun resist. Fast
weapon switch is **not** in the base set (admins add it via `gf_perk_on`).

Per-slot camo via `CalcWeaponOptions` (primary + independent secondary); rolled once at pool build.
Camo only renders on real-base weapons (the crossbow is the one pool secondary that shows it); pistols/
launchers are neutral-base no-ops. Special weapons need `PrecacheItem` in `onPrecacheGameType` or
`GiveWeapon` silently no-ops: `minigun_wager_mp`/`m202_flash_wager_mp` (the `_wager` builds, NOT the
killstreak names — those fire the "called-in" announcer + holster-lock), the `tabun_gas_mp`/
`nightingale_mp` tacticals, and `defaultweapon` (the Finger-Gun easter-egg, a real SP weapon def; icon =
`hud_death_suicide`). See [[special-weapons-precacheitem-and-camo]], [[invalid-weapon-finger-gun-fallback]],
[[reference_t5_mp_weapons]]. Dev aids: `gf_force_loadout`, `gf_force_camo`.

### Dynamic bot fill + team management
**One round-boundary reconciler** (`gf_reconcilerInit` in `_bot.gsc`, dev-only) is the single authority
over bot counts and placement; BotWarfare's own managers (`addBots`/`teamBots`/`doNonDediBots`) are
**deleted**. `gf_fill_n` = **per-team target N** (`3` → 3v3): each side is padded to exactly N *playing*
clients (humans+bots) at **each round start**, and **bots absorb all variance**. **Humans are never
auto-moved** (if humans on a side exceed N, that side's bots go to 0 and it stays big while the other
side still fills). Mid-round roster changes (and fill-N changes) are deliberately ignored until the next
boundary — worst case one ~45s round. `gf_fill_n 0` = reconciler inert — the mode in which manual
per-team bot add/kick/move sticks (with fill on, a manual move lasts at most until the round ends).

**Boundary-only = suicide-free + overshoot-free by construction.** ONE yield-free `gf_boundaryPass` per
round, triggered by: `gf_round_over` +0.5s (inside the killcam, where every eliminated bot is already
un-"playing"), the match-start gate release (`gf_load_gate_reset` with players present — pre-spawn, so
the round-1 wave reads the finished plan; the Auto/Manual lobby-release fire instead **kicks all bots**
pre-restart and the post-restart pass rebuilds the fill clean), and one roster-settle pass after init.
Placement is a **quiet pers reassign** (`gf_botQuietSetTeam`, mirror of the bridge's `gf_forceTeamQuiet`
— no suicide path exists); an **alive ("playing", incl. prematch-frozen) bot is never touched**: a
surplus one gets `pers["gf_parkPending"]` and `gf_lobbyMaySpawn` (gf.gsc) routes it to a clean spectator
in its next pre-spawn window. Adds are staggered (0.5s) and **generation-stamped** (`level.gf_fillGen` —
a newer pass cancels an older pass's add loop) with steer marks (`.gf_fillPending = team`, counted
toward the target team while mid-connect) — the old model's racing passes + wrong-team autoassign
landings were the "bots exceed the target" bug, and its mid-prematch stock switches racing the async
spawn commit were the "bots suicide during the countdown" bug. Displaced bots **park in spectator** for
reuse; the parked reserve is capped at the live human count (so *reducing* N kicks freed bots) and
`gf_fill_kick_floor` kicks parked bots before they breach `sv_maxclients`. Counts key off
`level.players` + `istestclient()`, never `level.bots` (which a restart desyncs). Every persistent bot
loop carries `endon("bot_reinit")`; `init()` fires `bot_reinit` before re-threading so a
restart-surviving manager set collapses to one. Full detail →
[[gf-fill-reconciler-and-team-transfer]], `docs/DEV.md`.

⚠ **`gf_boundaryListener` must NOT carry `endon("game_ended")`** — that notify fires at the end of
**every round**, not at match end (`endGame` runs yield-free to it, and `gf_endRound` threads `endGame`
in the same frame it notifies `gf_round_over`). Paired with the **once-per-match** `_bot::init` gate
(`game["gf_botInit"]`, `gf.gsc`), the endon killed the listener at the first round end and nothing ever
re-threaded it: **the boundary pass never ran at a boundary**, the fill froze at whatever
`gf_matchStartPass` left, and humans joining later were never counted → a side sat at N bots + humans
forever ("bot fill ignores humans"). `bot_reinit` is the only notify allowed to tear these down; the
final round is skipped by `gf_matchIsOver()`. `gf_gateListener` keeps the endon **deliberately** (dying
at round 1's end is what confines it to the match-start gate, since `gf_load_gate_reset` also fires every
round) — read a thread's intended lifetime before touching its endons.
([[game-ended-fires-every-round-end]])

### HUD (menu-layer)
All mod HUD is rendered in the **menu layer** (`ui_mp/hud_gf_health.menu`, in `mod.ff`), NOT client
hudelems, because T5 has an invisible per-client **DRAWN render cap (~17-20 elements)** shared across
*all* hudelem types; the old client-side panel blew past it and silently starved the score popup and OT
flag ([[settext-configstring-exhaustion]]). The server pushes `ui_gf_*` client dvars on-change; menu
itemDefs read them via `exp material(dvarString())`, `exp rect`, `exp forecolor A`, `visible when(...)`.
Materials **must** be dynamic `material(dvarString())` — a static `background "hud_..."` makes the linker
try to bundle the `.iwi` → build error.

- **Health panel:** two rows (row 0 = friendly green, row 1 = enemy red), each an HP number + bar +
  EITHER up to 4 skulls (both teams ≤4) OR an `Alive: N` readout (either team >4). The skull/readout
  mode (`ui_gf_hp_mode`) is shared so both rows switch together — this **is** the small/large coupling
  threshold. Each skull slot is two itemDefs (alive team-colour + dead white) because forecolor RGB
  isn't exp-drivable, only alpha.
- **Self health bar**, **loadout overview** (icons via `ui_gf_lo_*`; 3 hardcoded perk icons), and two
  separate menuDefs — **pregame lobby** (`gf_lobby_hud`) and the admin **pause banner** (`gf_pause_hud`,
  "MATCH PAUSED", gated on `ui_gf_paused`) — both gated `!BIT_IN_KILLCAM` not `BIT_HUD_VISIBLE`
  (the lobby cam clears hud_visible, and a pause can land in a state that has too).
- **Kill/score popup:** renders "Elimination"/"Assist" on its own `NewScoreHudElem` (`self.gf_popupElem`,
  a separate pool from the ~17 cap), styled to match the stock yellow popup; the engine's own
  `hud_rankscroreupdate` is parked offscreen each spawn so stock "+N" XP pushes can't race ours.

⚠ **Every `setClientDvar` is ONE reliable server command, and the client's ring buffer for them is
FIXED (`MAX_RELIABLE_COMMANDS`).** Blowing it produces **two different client `Com_Error` disconnects —
the same disease, detected at opposite ends**: **`Server command overflow`** (the *server* sees a client
stop acking and its outgoing queue overrun) and **`CL_CGameNeedsServerCommand: a reliable command was
cycled out`** (the *client* received everything but cgame reached for a command already overwritten in
its own ring). ⚠ **Never chase the second as a new bug** — both mean *too many reliable commands in a
window where the client isn't executing them*. That needs a **burst** *and* a **frozen** client, which is
why the one place it bites is the Auto/Manual **lobby START**: `map_restart(false)` stalls every client
while it re-inits, and the push burst lands inside that stall. **The fix is `setClientDvarS` (plural)** —
the stock variadic builtin that carries every name/value pair in a **single** command (stock:
`_globallogic_player.gsc:91`; 9 pairs in one call at `_zombiemode_challenges.gsc:217`). The spawn burst is
batched into groups of ≤8 pairs, taking it from **~45 commands/human to ~12**; `gf_pushHealthRow` pushes
its whole row as one command whenever *any* of its 5 values changes (fewer commands than the old per-dvar
path on **both** the spawn burst and the 0.1 s in-firefight loop — re-sending an unchanged pair inside a
batch is free; it's the command **count** that is scarce).
⚠ **A `grep setClientDvar` audit is NOT enough — hunt the O(n²) call: a loop over players containing a
loop over data.** That is what the first batching pass missed. `gf_lobbyRosterLoop` pushed `pcount` **plus
one command per occupied name slot, per human, per roster change** — the only stream in the mod whose cost
scales with player count, sitting *in the lobby*, the tightest window there is. It compounded with the bot
fill (the reconciler adds on a 0.5s stagger; the loop ticks at 0.5s → ~one roster change **per bot**), so a
12-bot fill cost **~156 reliable commands per human** — over the ring on its own. Now padded to the 12 fixed
slots and pushed as flat batched groups (1 command for a ≤6 lobby, 2 for 7-12).
⚠ **Never expand a batch back into individual pushes**, and never add an unbatched per-player push loop.
`gf_hudRevealStagger` spreads what's left across frames — it is a complement to the batching, **not** a
substitute. ⚠ **Our share is not proven to be the dominant one**: `map_restart(false)` also makes the engine
re-send configstrings (themselves reliable commands) and the bot kick-all fires immediately before it. If
"cycled out" recurs, the next lever is to **stop churning bots across the restart**, not to shave more mod
pushes ([[server-command-overflow-reliable-command-budget]], [[connection-interrupted-mitigations]]).
⚠ **A GSC dvar animation is a reliable-command STREAM** — `gf_slideLoadout` pushes one *batched* command
per 0.05 s step for the whole duration (the 0.5 s loadout outro = **~13** commands/human/round, halved
from 26 by batching the off+alpha pair; `gf_fadeDvar` is currently dead code — the panel reveal snaps).
Batching is the floor here, not the fix: an animation is a stream by construction. The menu layer can
own a time-based animation for free (`milliseconds()` in an `exp`, e.g. `ui_time_marker` +
`exec "setdvartotime"` in stock `after_action_report.menu` / `game_summary.menu`) — **but** the menu's
only clock is **client-local**, so a marker must be stamped *by the client* from a menu event; the
server cannot push one in its own `gettime()` base. Unverified whether an always-loaded `loadMenu` HUD
menu can fire such an event per round — see the open TODO.

Menu **structure** changes need a `mod.ff`
rebuild; dvar values/positions are GSC-tunable. Intro slide/fade animations are currently disabled
(snap-in); only the loadout outro animates. Related: [[menu-rendered-loadout-overview]],
[[script-hudelem-number-oversized]]. Full ui_gf_* map → `docs/REFERENCE.md`.

### Damage scoring, friendly fire, flinch, vision
- **Score = total damage dealt** (`gf_onPlayerDamage`), capped per hit at the victim's current HP (no
  overkill inflation), pushed silently (bypasses the stock rank-popup so score doesn't flash each hit).
- **Rank XP is 5× stock and lives ONLY in `registerScoreInfo`** (`gf.gsc onStartGameType`): **kill 500**,
  **headshot +500** (both fire on a headshot kill → 1000), **assist 100**, and the win/loss/tie **match-bonus
  scalars 5 / 2.5 / 3.75** (stock 1 / 0.5 / 0.75 — these are multipliers on stock's
  `scalar × (timeLimit × SPM) × timePlayedFrac`, not flat XP). XP and score are **fully decoupled**:
  `level.overridePlayerScore = true` makes `_globallogic_score::givePlayerScore` return on its first line, so
  no XP value can ever reach the damage scoreboard, and the stock "+N" popup is killed by `self.enableText =
  false` (per spawn) — **not** by the values, which is why they're safe to be non-zero.
  ⚠ **`scr_xpscale` is READ-ONLY on Plutonium T5 — it is not an XP lever.** rcon *and* `dedicated.cfg` both
  get `Error: scr_xpscale is read only` (proven live; that boot error in `console_mp.log` is our own cfg line
  being rejected), so it is pinned at **1** forever. The only script-side equivalent is assigning
  `level.xpScale` after `_rank::init` — we don't; the `registerScoreInfo` values *are* the knob.
  ⚠ **Kill XP flows from `Callback_PlayerKilled` → `giveKillStats`, NOT from our `level.onPlayerKilled` hook**,
  so it needs no wiring. **Assists do** — `gf_onPlayerKilled` must call `_rank::giveRankXP("assist")`
  **directly**, because stock's assist/capture/defend XP all routes through the dead `givePlayerScore` path.
  Same reason the OT flag capture pays **no** XP (stock `capture` 300 is unreachable) — wire it directly if
  we ever want it. ⚠ The end-of-match bonus is gated on `game["timepassed"]`, which only accrues while
  `!level.timerStopped` — and our round clock holds `pauseTimer()` all round ([[paused-timer-freezes-gettimepassed]]),
  so it may never fire. **Unverified** (`logString` output does not reach `games_mp.log` on this server, so the
  log can't answer it) — combat XP above is deliberately the load-bearing path.
- **Friendly fire is 100% stock** — the mod GSC sets no FF dvar. It's owned by the RCON panel writing the
  stock tweakables `scr_team_fftype` (base) + `scr_gf_team_fftype` (per-gametype override the engine
  re-polls ~5s). FF damage is applied by the engine but never scored. ([[t5-tweakable-override-dvars-live]])
- **Flinch — ONE lever now: `scr_gf_flinch`, shipped at 0.5 = half stock kick.** It is a straight
  multiplier on `bg_viewKickScale` (stock 0.2), so 1.0 really is stock and 0 really is none.
  ⚠ **The second lever was a PERK, and it was 5× stronger than the dvar.** `specialty_bulletflinch`
  (Hardened Pro) gates the engine's **`perk_damageKickReduction`**, whose registered default `0.2` is the
  fraction of kick **REMAINING** — an **80% cut** — not the fraction removed (stock's own custom-games perk
  editor maps its `"80%"` label to the value `0.2`: `ui_mp/custom_specialty_editor.menu`). Plutonium ships
  `g_fix_damageKickReductionPerk 1`, so it genuinely applies. It was in the **base set**, so the live VPS
  ran `0.2 × 0.5 × 0.2` = **10% of stock flinch** ("flinch feels like zero"), and `scr_gf_flinch` could not
  have restored stock even at its clamp ceiling of 3 (that only reaches 60%). The perk now rides in the
  **sniper/heavy package only** (those 10 loadouts take a further 0.2×), where flinch resistance is a
  deliberate class trait. ⚠ **Never put `specialty_bulletflinch` back in the base set** — it silently
  turns `scr_gf_flinch` into a lie. ⚠ Hardened Pro is **two** tokens (`specialty_armorpiercing` +
  `specialty_bulletflinch`); the package used to carry only the base `specialty_bulletpenetration`, so
  granting "Hardened Pro" means adding the flinch token explicitly
  ([[hardened-pro-flinch-perk-multiplier]]). `gf_applyFlinch` re-applies it every round. ⚠ **`bg_viewKickScale` does NOT replicate** — each client
  scales its own damage view kick from its LOCAL copy, so the server-side `setDvar` alone changes nothing
  for anyone on a dedicated server (it only ever appeared to work on a listen host, where the host *is* a
  client). So the value is **pushed per-client**: to live humans in `gf_applyFlinch`, and per-spawn via
  `gf_applyFlinchClient`, which pushes **unconditionally**. ⚠ **There is deliberately no skip-at-stock
  shortcut**: the old code returned early at `scale == 1`, which only *looks* harmless at a 0.5 default (we
  push anyway) — that is how it survived — and at a 1.0 default it would mean the server never pushes at
  all. `bg_viewKickScale` is a plain client dvar a player can set in their own autoexec, so anyone running
  `bg_viewKickScale 0` would take **zero flinch while everyone else takes the full kick**. The
  unconditional push is what makes the server's value authoritative. Session-only; `bg_viewKickScale` is
  not a saved client dvar. ⚠ The two `gf_cfgFloat` defaults (`gf_applyFlinch` + `gf_applyFlinchClient`)
  must stay in lockstep — the seed is seed-if-empty, so a drift is masked by whichever ran first.
  ([[flinch-bg-viewkickscale-not-replicated]])
- ⚠ **Every `perk_*` dvar is a MAGNITUDE; the matching `specialty_*` perk is its GATE.** The engine (or
  `_class.gsc`) only consults the dvar for a player who **has** the perk — they never "fight", but a
  slider whose gate nobody holds is a **dead control that silently does nothing**. Scopes: `perk_speedMultiplier`
  (Lightweight), `perk_sprintMultiplier` (Marathon) and **`perk_weapMeleeMultiplier`** (Steady Aim Pro's
  `fastmeleerecovery`) are **BASE** — live for everyone. `perk_weapSwitchMultiplier` / `_weapReloadMultiplier` /
  `_sprintRecoveryMultiplier` / `_weapSpreadMultiplier` are **SNIPER/HEAVY only** (10 of 53 rounds).
  **`perk_weapRateMultiplier` is DEAD** (gate `specialty_rof`, granted by nobody), and **`perk_weapAdsMultiplier`
  is DEAD** for the reason below.
- ⚠⚠ **A `perk_*` multiplier's REGISTERED DEFAULT *is* the perk's effect — and `1.0` is NOT "stock", it is
  the WORST value.** Live-read defaults: `weapReload`/`weapAds`/`weapSwitch`/`weapMelee` **0.5**,
  `weapSpread` **0.65**, `weapRate` **0.75**, `sprintRecovery` **0.6** — all with a domain that **CAPS AT 1**.
  So 0.5 = "the action takes half as long", and setting 1.0 **silently disables the perk's benefit**. Two of
  these run the other way: `sprintMultiplier` (default **2**, domain 0-3) and `speedMultiplier` (**1.07**,
  0-5) are *higher = more*. ⚠ The panel shipped `def:'1.0'` + ranges to 2.0 on all eight — its Reset button
  was **disabling** the perks it claimed to tune, and every value >1 it offered was **rejected by the
  server** (which reads as "the dvar is broken"). Fixed. **Never re-guess a default here — read it off the
  running server** ([[perk-multiplier-defaults-are-the-effect]], [[read-the-server-not-the-file]]).
- ⚠ **`specialty_fastads` NEVER STICKS — it is a dead perk.** Proven live with `pperkdump_<num>`: with
  `gf_perk_on` listing 7 perks, **6 land on every player and `fastads` never does**, while 11 other perks
  set in the same loop all do. It is a real engine token (used by stock `shrp.gsc`) and nothing unsets it —
  root cause unknown. Consequences: **Sleight of Hand Pro cannot be granted**, and `perk_weapAdsMultiplier`
  is a dead slider. It still sits in the sniper/heavy package doing nothing; leave it until the cause is
  found (removing it would delete a real effect if `hasPerk` — not `SetPerk` — turns out to be the liar).
- **`g_fix_viewkick_dupe` is INERT on T5 MP — it was never the second flinch multiplier.** (The real one
  was a **perk**: `specialty_bulletflinch` → `perk_damageKickReduction` 0.2×, now out of the base set —
  see Flinch above.) With that perk gone, `scr_gf_flinch` is the only *global* flinch knob and `0.5` →
  `bg_viewKickScale 0.1` is exactly half stock. This file previously claimed
  the dvar doubled felt flinch, on the strength of it *appearing* in the `console_mp.log` dump — which
  proves nothing, because a cfg-created dvar appears there too. A **live RCON read** settles it: the real
  fixes carry a typed domain and a fixed registered default (`g_fixBulletDamageDupe` → `is:"1"
  default:"0" Domain is 0 or 1` — the default stays `0` even though we set `1`), whereas
  `g_fix_viewkick_dupe` → `is:"1" default:"1" **Domain is any text**`, i.e. its "default" merely mirrors
  the value **our own cfg** set. The engine never registered it (Plutonium filed that fix under **SP**).
  Setting it is harmless but does nothing. The panel row is kept, labelled `(INERT)`, so a future
  Plutonium build that *does* register it is easy to spot. ([[engine-dvar-defaults-from-log-dump]])
- **Jump fatigue is OFF** (`scr_gf_jump_fatigue`, default 0 — shipped, public build included). "Jump
  fatigue" is the community name for the engine's **`jump_slowdownEnable`** (stock `1`): every jump drags
  your movement speed, so consecutive hops decay. 42s rounds on wager-sized maps live on short
  repositioning hops, so the stock drag punishes exactly the movement this mode is built on. There is no
  dvar *named* fatigue — the whole engine family is `jump_height` / `jump_slowdownEnable` / `jump_spreadAdd`
  / `jump_stepSize` / `jump_ladderPushVel`. `gf_applyJumpFatigue` (`_gf_rounds.gsc`) re-applies it every
  round; RCON bridge `jumpfatigue_<0|1>`. No per-client push (the `jump_*` family replicates — it must,
  movement is client-predicted), which is what makes it *unlike* flinch.
- **Unlimited sprint is OFF** (`scr_gf_sprint_unlimited`, default 0 — Marathon is already in the base perk
  set). ⚠ **`player_sprintUnlimited` is a CLIENT dvar** — `player_*` is client-predicted movement, the same
  ownership class as `bg_*`, **not** the replicated `jump_*` family. It is owned exactly like flinch:
  `gf_applySprintUnlimited` (every round, from `onStartGameType`) sets the server copy — the server's own
  movement sim reads it, and a client predicting unlimited sprint against a server that limits it
  rubber-bands — and `gf_applySprintUnlimitedClient` pushes it per human **every spawn**. RCON bridge
  `sprintunlimited_<0|1>`. ⚠ **Never `set player_sprintUnlimited` directly** (cfg or rcon): stock's *only*
  client push is `_globallogic_player::Callback_PlayerConnect`'s
  `if (GetDvarInt(#"player_sprintUnlimited")) self setClientDvar(..., 1)` — it fires **at connect only**
  (it does re-run on `map_restart`, so per-round in practice) and it is **one-way**: stock can turn
  unlimited sprint **on** and can *never* turn it back **off**, so a client handed a 1 keeps it for its
  whole session. That one-way connect push is why the old panel toggle looked like it randomly stopped
  working. ⚠ Unlike `gf_applyFlinchClient`, the per-spawn push has **no skip-at-stock shortcut** — skipping
  at 0 would strand a client that was given a 1 earlier in the session.
- ⚠ **CHEAT PROTECTION IS A *CLIENT-SIDE* CHECK — an rcon / `dedicated.cfg` `set` on a dedicated server
  is NOT gated by it.** This is the opposite of what this file and `_gf_bridge.gsc` used to say, and the
  mistake cost a whole wrong "fix": the familiar `Error: jump_height is cheat protected` spam comes from a
  game **CLIENT** exec'ing the stock `default_xboxlive.cfg` at boot — *not* from a server refusing you.
  The `DVAR_CHEAT` flag bites wherever the console belongs to a client: a player's own console, a client
  exec'ing a cfg, and a `setClientDvar` **arriving** at a client. The **dedicated server's own console
  (rcon + `dedicated.cfg`) is not gated**, so `jump_height`, `bg_fallDamage*`, `bg_gravity`, `g_speed`,
  `timescale` etc. are all settable there with a plain `set`, `sv_cheats 0` and all.
  **Proven live on the VPS 2026-07-12** (`sv_cheats 0`, `dedicated` = "dedicated internet server"):
  rcon `set ragdoll_explode_force 18001` — a dvar on the engine's *own* cheat-protected list — read back
  as `18001` (then restored to 18000). Control in the same session: `set bg_gravity 0` (domain starts at
  1) **did** echo its rejection back and kept 800 — so error echoes genuinely reach the panel, and the
  silence on the accepted writes was a real accept, not a swallowed reply.
  ⚠ **What IS unreachable on a dedicated server** (and the only thing the panel is right to grey out) is
  a **cheat-protected CLIENT dvar** — the `r_*` Visual Tweaks — because those ride `setClientDvar` and the
  *client* re-checks on arrival; plus **archived/saved** client dvars (`cg_fov`, `bg_viewBobAmplitudeBase`),
  which Plutonium refuses to let a server write at all.
  ⚠ So **do not route a server dvar through the bridge's `svset_` on the theory that rcon cannot reach
  it** — rcon can. `svset_` survives for two narrower reasons: the **listen/dev host**, where the panel's
  rcon lands on a console that *is* a client's (that is the setup where `set bg_viewKickScale 0.9` was
  once seen refused, which is what seeded the whole misconception), and its `gf_<dvar>` mirror, which
  buys cfg-persistence for free.
- **Reading engine-dvar defaults:** the dvar dump in `console_mp.log` prints **registered defaults, never
  live values** (`g_inactivity` 190 vs our cfg's 300; `sv_maxclients` 4 vs 14). It is the cheapest way to
  read an engine dvar's true default and to prove a dvar is engine-registered at all — a `set` on a name
  the engine never registers creates a user dvar that looks real in every dump and is read by nothing.
  For **live** values use the panel (`/api/dvars?fresh=1`), never the dump and never the cfg.
  ([[engine-dvar-defaults-from-log-dump]], [[read-the-server-not-the-file]])
- ⚠ **THE `bg_*` / `cg_*` PREFIX RULE — a server-side `set` on one is INERT on a dedicated server.**
  The prefix *is* the ownership marker: **`g_`/`sv_`/`scr_` = server** (a `set` works), **`bg_` =
  shared/predicted** and **`cg_` = client game** (every client reads its **own local copy**; the server's
  copy replicates to nobody). This has now bitten twice — `bg_viewKickScale` (flinch), which is why the
  mod must **push it per-client** via `setClientDvar` every spawn, and `bg_viewBobAmplitudeBase`, whose
  `dedicated.cfg` line was commented "bg_* replicates to all clients" and **did nothing for years**.
  It only ever *appears* to work on a listen host, where the host **is** a client.
  **Before setting any dvar server-side, read its prefix.** If it is `bg_`/`cg_`, you have exactly three
  options: push it per-client from GSC (the flinch pattern), hand the player the console command (the
  panel's 📋 clipboard button on the Bob slider), or accept that it is decoration. `cg_hudGrenadeIcon-
  ShowFriendly` in `dedicated.cfg.example` is unaudited and likely inert for the same reason.
  ([[flinch-bg-viewkickscale-not-replicated]])
- **Vision — the contrast pop is Gunfight's DEFAULT look, in every build** (`_gf_rounds.gsc`,
  shipped): `gf_initRoundVision` (called from `onStartGameType`) stamps `level.gf_defaultVision` =
  the map's own set and threads `gf_applyRoundVision`, which **waits for `prematch_over`** and then
  `visionSetNaked( "default_night", 3.0 )` — the `"enhance"` key (saturation 1, contrast 1.2).
  ⚠ It **cannot** be applied from `onStartGameType`: the stock prematch stomps vision *afterwards*
  (matchStartTimer forces `mpIntro`, then at T-2s blends back to the map vision over 3s), so we take
  over the tail of that blend — the 3.0s transition is what makes the reveal read as native. Vision is
  `level` state, so `map_restart` wipes it and this re-runs **every round**.
  The RCON `vision_<key>` override layers on top: it persists a key in `gf_vis_vision`, which
  `gf_roundVisionKey()` reads **inside a strip region** — so the public build has no dvar read at all
  and is always the default. ⚠ **Empty `gf_vis_vision` means "the gf default", NOT "the map vision"** —
  the bare map vision is reachable only via the *explicit* `normal` key, which is why `gf_bridgeVision`
  persists the string `"normal"` instead of clearing the dvar, and why `visreset` restores *enhance*.
- **Video (`r_*`) is stock and stays stock.** `gf_vis_*` server dvars map to client `r_*` (ambient/
  gridint/gridcon/hdr/fog), pushed per human spawn only if non-empty — but these are cheat-protected
  and **unreliable on dedicated**, which is exactly why the look lever above is `visionSetNaked` and
  not r_* ([[rcon-dedicated-dvar-push-limits]]). RCON-only, stripped from public builds. `r_gamma` is a
  saved client dvar Plutonium blocks.
- **Headshots-only** (`level.gf_headshotsOnly`) is a dev-bridge flag, off/undefined in public builds.

### Spawns & wager map zone
Curated hand-placed spawns for **25 maps** (`_gf_locations.gsc`, built once/match, cached in `game[]`);
each map has one set of 5 allies + 5 axis points and one OT flag point. Small mode consumes them via
`onSpawnPlayer`/`onSpawnPlayerUnified`, which **short-circuits all small-mode spawns to the curated
points** so late/async spawns (bot fill, late joiners, 60s forceSpawn) keep fight-facing points instead
of the stock scored pool ([[spawn-wrong-facing-usestartspawns-gate]]). An unlisted map (e.g.
`mp_firingrange`) gets no curated data and degrades to `mp_tdm_spawn` + native Dom-B OT flag — omitting a
map is the supported opt-out ([[firingrange-intentional-bigmap-default]]). ⚠ The curated branch must set
`self.lastSpawnTime`/`lastSpawnPoint` (stock `Callback_PlayerDamage` does unguarded arithmetic on them
for grenade spawn-protection) and does a `positionWouldTelefrag` scan (spawning onto an occupied point
kills the occupant).

**Wager zone without the wager framework:** small mode uses stock `mp_wager_spawn` entities and **keeps
the baked wager blocker entities** (map ents tagged `script_gameobjectname "gun oic hlnd shrp"`) by
adding those four tags to the `_gameobjects::main` allow-list (`["gf","dom"]` + the four in small mode;
large mode omits them so the map opens up; `dom` always kept so the OT B flag survives). A wager compass
material is applied for a 14-map whitelist (the art must be resident — First Strike/Escalation maps keep
their full compass). ⚠ `xblive_wagermatch` is **not** set in `gf.gsc` (the map reads it at level-load,
before the gametype `main()` runs) — it's set to `0` (or `1` for gun/oic/shrp/hlnd) by the RCON map page
before the map loads.

**Hotel's elevators are OFF, and the switch is 100% stock.** `mp_hotel` does **not** use the generic
`maps/mp/_elevator.gsc` (the `elevator_trigger` system) — it ships its **own** `maps/mp/mp_hotel_elevators.gsc`,
which is **not in the `raw/` dump** and had to be pulled out of `zone/Common/mp_hotel.ff`
([[extract-dlc-map-gsc-from-fastfile]]). That script reads **`scr_elevator_failsafe`** (and forces it on
itself when `xblive_wagermatch == 1`, which is why the wager gametypes already ran Hotel with dead lifts —
only `gf` still had them live). Set, it parks both cars at the lower floor, slams the car + floor doors
shut, `DisconnectPaths()` on both levels, retitles the use triggers to "ELEVATOR UNAVAILABLE", and
`return`s **before the trigger loop ever arms** — so the shaft is *sealed*, not left as an open hole — and
short-circuits `elevator_prox_think` so bots stop pathing over to ride. We want it off because a 42s
one-life round has no room for a 3s ride + 3s cooldown lift that can strand a player, and the elevator's
own obstruction handler `DoDamage`s anyone the doors close on (a free kill the map hands out).
⚠ **Read at LEVEL LOAD** — `mp_hotel::main()` → `mp_hotel_elevators::init()` runs *before* the gametype
`main()`, exactly like `xblive_wagermatch`. So the `gf.gsc` seed only lands from the **next** map onward;
`dedicated.cfg` carries it too for the boot-straight-onto-Hotel case, and the panel badges the row
`NEXT MAP`. Same script also exposes `scr_elevator_max_riders` (3), `_cooldown_time` (3), `_move_time` (3)
if a softer nerf is ever wanted.

### RCON bridge + admin panel (dev-only)
Both are stripped from public builds; a public build has no RCON control. **`_gf_bridge.gsc`** is the
GSC side: the panel writes `set gf_cmd <seq>:<cmd>`, `gf_bridgePoll` reads+clears at 20 Hz and writes
`gf_ack`, with high-water seq dedup (`level.gf_ackSeq`) so a dropped-packet retry can't double-fire a
non-idempotent command. ⚠ The mark is **seeded from the `gf_ack` dvar every round, never reset** — a
command that restarts the match itself (`matchrestart`, `lobbystart`) wipes the round that owed it an
ack, so a reset would leave the panel un-acked → it resends the same seq → the wiped mark lets it
**re-run** (one click, N restarts, each re-arming the next). Telemetry (dedicated-only single-token reads): **`gf_state`** (11 colon fields:
`wA:wX:round:aliveA:aliveX:gametype:hold:fillN:pAllies:pAxis:parked`) and **`gf_roster`**
(`<num>,<team>,<alive>,<pending>,<bot>;…`). Command feedback is private to `gf_admin_guids`
(`gf_bridgeNotify`); only `saymsg` broadcasts. Team moves: `pteam_<num>_<team>` defers to next-round
prematch (`pers["gf_pendingTeam"]`, applied on `spawned_player`); `pteamforce_` applies now (respawns).
⚠ A live human cannot be moved without dying — deferral is why. Verbs cover bots, balance-teams,
match-control (`lobbystart`, endround, the two restarts, pause/resume), gameplay toggles, and fun/visual
commands. **`roundrestart`** replays the round with no score/loadout-rotation/side-switch by ending it as
a `"tie"` through `gf_endRound` with `game["roundsplayed"]` pre-decremented (endGame's `++` nets it back)
and `level.roundswitch` zeroed for the cycle. **`matchrestart`** restarts the match (scores 0-0, round 1,
same map + teams) by reusing the lobby's fast-restart plumbing: snapshot the sides into the
`gf_teamplan`/`gf_botplan` dvars + `gf_matchArmed=1`, fire `game_ended`, `map_restart(false)` — so the
post-restart gate skips the lobby hold and re-applies the plan. ⚠ Neither restart may be a raw
`fast_restart` / `map_restart`: those skip `_globallogic::endGame`, so the `game_ended` notify that tears
down every per-round `endon("game_ended")` thread never fires — the old round's loops survive as a second
copy AND the engine's re-`InitGame` stacks a second `prematchPeriod()`/`gameTimer()` (double countdown).
**Pause** delegates the freeze to the mod clock (`gf_pauseMatch` — live clock + controls + bots +
`level.gf_matchPaused`, which drives the `gf_pause_hud` "MATCH PAUSED" menuDef) and keeps the B&W
vision on the bridge side, since only the bridge knows the `gf_vis_vision` key to restore on resume;
a `vision_*`/`visreset` issued mid-pause persists its key but doesn't apply until resume. `gf_bridgeInit` re-threads its loops every round behind a `gf_bridge_reinit`
collapse notify ([[onstartgametype-perround-thread-accumulation]]).

**`tools/rcon/`** is a loopback-only (127.0.0.1) Node admin panel (never web-deployed). Its transport is
the load-bearing part: Plutonium answers ~1 RCON reply per 0.7s and silently drops faster sends, so
**everything goes through one paced (`RCON_MIN_GAP=850ms`), priority, coalescing queue**. The UI runs a
single self-scheduling `pollTick` → `/api/tick` (chains `status;gf_state;gf_roster` into one send).
⚠ **Never add another RCON poller** — box services read through the panel API instead
([[rcon-panel-queue-saturation]]). Panel UI: FAVORITES (landing tab) / DASHBOARD / MAPS (live
`sv_maprotation` editor — [[rcon-map-rotation-editor]]) / ADVANCED / CONSOLE tabs; explicit-flex
`layoutColumns` (not CSS multicolumn); a dead-dvar cache silences "Unknown cmd" probing
([[rcon-connect-sweep-unknown-cmd-spam]]). **FAVORITES** is a pinboard: a ☆ pins either a single
**row** (on any DASHBOARD/ADVANCED settings row) or a **whole block** (on its section title — the only
way the non-row controls reach the pinboard, e.g. BOTS' Add Bot / Kick All / per-team ± / difficulty
buttons, which are not settings rows and have no star of their own). Either way the pin is the **same
DOM node, borrowed** — moved out of its home while the tab is open and put straight back on leaving.
Never render a second copy of a control: reads (`srvApplyValues`) and writes (`sdve`/`sdvv`, Set All,
💾 Save) are keyed by element id / `data-dvar`, so a duplicate id silently drifts out of sync with the
server. ⚠ For the same reason a row inside a **pinned block** is skipped by `favBuild` rather than
borrowed twice. Pins land in one of the five **`FAV_CATS`** categories (MATCH START / GAMEPLAY / BOTS &
PLAYERS / FUN & VISUALS / SERVER), not under their home block — pinning six rows from six blocks used
to make six one-row groups; the home block survives as an `.sgroup` sub-header, an unmapped block falls
through to SERVER, and an empty category doesn't render. A borrowed block renders flush inside its
category (chrome stripped by `#p-fav .block .block` CSS, its own Set All row hidden so the category's
single one governs) and is **excluded from `layoutColumns`' items** — it is content of the category
block, not a column item, and hoisting it would tear it out of its category. Per-gametype rows
(`#srv-gt-body`) are deliberately not pinnable — that block is re-rendered on every dropdown change,
which would destroy a borrowed row's home. ⚠ `_gsClean` / `_blockKey` strip `.fav-star`: a block's
star lives *inside* its `.btitle` and its glyph flips ☆↔★, so an unstripped key would change the
moment you pinned it (breaking both the pin key and the saved fold state). ⚠ **The pinboard is stored SERVER-side** — the panel's
gitignored `tools/rcon/prefs.local.json` via `GET`/`POST /api/prefs`, `localStorage.gf_favs` is only a
first-paint cache — so it follows the **panel process**, not the browser: the VPS panel is one pinboard
whether you reach it by RDP or over the SSH tunnel from the laptop, and a laptop's own local panel keeps
its own. `deploy.ps1` `/XF`-excludes the file so `/MIR` can't delete it. Any settings row also answers a
**right-click** (`showRowCtx`): copy its dvar, pin/unpin, reset to default — the default read from the
DOM's own `defaultValue`/`defaultChecked` (so nothing carries a second copy of it), and pushed back
through the row's **own** apply button / change handler, so a reset can't drift from the row's transport.
Per-profile passwords live in gitignored `secrets.local.json`. ⚠ Status/dvar parsing is **end-anchored**
because names can contain spaces (a bot "MCG Gordon" would otherwise leak in as a human —
[[status-parser-name-spaces-bot-miscount]]).

## Gametype dvars

Set in `dedicated.cfg` or via RCON. The `scr_gf_*` family persists through `map_restart(true)`. Almost
every mod dvar is **seeded in `gf.gsc onStartGameType`** so the panel's connect-sweep never reads an
unregistered dvar (which echoes "Unknown cmd"); clamps live at the read site (`gf_cfgFloat(dvar,def,lo,hi)`).
**Rule: any new panel-read dvar must be seeded there.** Full ranges + `level.*`/`game[]`/`pers[]` var
tables → `docs/REFERENCE.md`.

**Gunfight rules**
| dvar | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `scr_gf_scorelimit` | 6 | Round wins to win the match (the real match-end threshold). |
| `scr_gf_roundswitch` | 2 | Rounds between side switches. |
| `scr_gf_roundsperloadout` | 2 | Rounds before the shared loadout rotates (clamp 1-9). |
| `scr_gf_timelimit` / `_large` | 0.7 / 1.5 | Round length in minutes, small / large mode (0.7 = 42s). |
| `scr_gf_overtimelimit` / `_large` | 15 / 30 | Overtime seconds, small / large; `0` = OT off (HP decides now). |
| `gf_capture_time` / `_large` | 3.5 / 5 | OT zone hold-to-capture seconds, small / large. |
| `scr_gf_teamspawnmode` | auto | `auto` \| `large` \| `small` (auto goes large when a team hits 5+). |
| `scr_gf_flinch` | 0.5 | Flinch scale (× stock `bg_viewKickScale` 0.2) → **half stock kick**. The **only global flinch reducer**: 1.0 = stock, 0 = none. (The sniper/heavy package's `specialty_bulletflinch` adds a further **0.2×** for those 10 loadouts only — never put it back in the base set.) Pushed **per-client every spawn, unconditionally** — the server dvar alone doesn't replicate, and the push beats a player's own autoexec (clamp 0-3). |
| `scr_gf_killcam_slowmo` | 0.6 | The round-end killcam's **timescale FLOOR** (clamp 0.25-1.0) — **not a toggle** (it used to be one; 0/1 no longer mean what they did). `0.25` = stock BO1 cinematic **and the bug**; `1.0` = no slow motion. Stock's 0.25 spaces the server's game frames ~200ms apart, overrunning `MAX_PACKET_USERCMDS` (32) on any client above ~160 fps → the "Connection Interrupted" plug. `0.6` → ~83ms, safe to ~385 fps, still a clear slow-mo. Clamp the **depth, not the length**. ⚠ `sv_fps` is not the lever — it truncates the killcam's frame-sized archive ring. |
| `scr_gf_jump_fatigue` | 0 | **0 = OFF (the GF default)** / 1 = stock. Drives the engine's `jump_slowdownEnable` (post-jump movement drag — "jump fatigue"). The mod owns it so OFF ships as a default even with no cfg and no panel (`gf_applyJumpFatigue`, re-applied every round). RCON bridge: `jumpfatigue_<0\|1>`. |
| `scr_gf_sprint_unlimited` | 0 | **0 = stock** / 1 = the sprint meter never empties. Drives the client dvar `player_sprintUnlimited`, **pushed per-client every spawn** — stock's only push is at connect and is ON-only, so a bare `set` on it reaches nobody already in the server and can never turn it back off (`gf_applySprintUnlimited` + `_Client`). RCON bridge: `sprintunlimited_<0\|1>`. |
| `scr_elevator_failsafe` | 1 | **ENGINE/map dvar, read at LEVEL LOAD → next map only.** `1` = **Hotel's elevators are disabled** (the GF default): cars parked at the lower floor, car + floor doors shut, `DisconnectPaths()` both levels, use triggers retitled "ELEVATOR UNAVAILABLE", bot prox-think short-circuited. 100% stock — `mp_hotel` ships its **own** elevator script (`maps/mp/mp_hotel_elevators.gsc`, **not** the generic `maps/mp/_elevator.gsc`) and Treyarch built this switch into it; stock forces it on for `xblive_wagermatch 1`, so the wager gametypes already ran Hotel dead. Seeded if-empty in `gf.gsc onStartGameType` (**outside** the strip regions — it ships in the public build) + set in `dedicated.cfg`, for the boot-straight-onto-Hotel case. No effect on any other map. |
| `g_fix_viewkick_dupe` | 1 | **INERT on T5 MP** — the engine never registered it (live read: `Domain is any text`, `default:` mirrors our own `set`). Harmless, does nothing. Flinch is `scr_gf_flinch` alone. |
| `scr_team_maxsize` | 0 (cfg ships 6) | `>0` caps players/team; overflow → spectator on spawn. |

**Match start / pregame lobby** (match's first round only)
| dvar | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `scr_gf_match_prematch_seconds` / `scr_gf_prematch_seconds` | 20 / 7 | Native prematch countdown length: first round / later rounds. |
| `scr_gf_min_players` | 1 | Min **humans** to start (1 = off); a release condition on the pre-prematch hold. |
| `scr_gf_minplayers_timer` | 0 | Min-players "start anyway" ceiling (s); **0 = never auto-start**. |
| `scr_gf_load_wait` | 10 | Max s to hold the prematch for still-loading clients — a **ceiling**, not a duration (releases the moment the last loader is off its loading screen). `0` = off. ⚠ Any non-zero value **arms the hold**, and the 3s arrival floor is then unconditional: every match start pays 3s even with nobody loading (the floor exists so a poll running before the engine has delivered the first connect callbacks can't wave the gate through on an empty tracker). |
| `scr_gf_load_grace` | 20 | s past prematch_over to keep round-1 grace open for a straggler loader (0 = off). |
| `scr_gf_lobby` | 0 | Match Start: **0 Normal** / **1 Auto** / **2 Manual** (Auto/Manual fast-restart via `map_restart(false)`). |
| `scr_gf_lobby_timer` | 600 | Manual-lobby auto-start ceiling (s); 0 = never auto-start. |
| `g_pregame_enabled` | 0 | **ENGINE** dvar, read at **level load** → **next map only**. `1` = run BO1's stock pre-match warmup lobby (`maps/mp/gametypes/_pregame`) before the match. 100% native; the mod only seeds + exposes it. |
| `party_minplayers` | 2 | Players the **stock warmup** waits for (its only gate). Counts bots. Unrelated to `scr_gf_min_players`. |
| `scr_pregame_timelimit` | 0 | Warmup time limit (min). ⚠ Keep **0** — stock registers it seed-if-empty at 5, and its time-out **rotates the map** instead of starting the match. Seeded to 0 by `gf.gsc` (strip-marked) + `dedicated.cfg.example`. |

**Bots** (dev-only reconciler)
| dvar | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `gf_fill_n` | 0 | Per-team fill target N (3 = 3v3); **0 = reconciler inert** (manual bot control sticks). Clamp 0-6. |
| `gf_fill_kick_floor` | 2 | Client slots kept free for humans; a parked bot is kicked once total ≥ `sv_maxclients − this`. |
| `bot_difficulty` | fu | BotWarfare AI difficulty (easy/normal/hard/fu). Seeded if-empty in `gf.gsc` (a `dedicated.cfg` value or a live panel `botdiff_*` wins); `_bot::diffBots` re-applies the preset from it every 1.5s. |

**Perks / RCON-managed / plumbing**
| dvar | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `gf_perk_on` / `gf_perk_off` | "" | Comma-separated perk lists added/removed after the base set. |
| `gf_admin_guids` | "" | GUID allowlist for private bridge command feedback. |
| `gf_teamplan` / `gf_botplan` / `gf_matchArmed` | "" / "" / "" | Lobby→match transfer + loop-break plumbing (dvars because `map_restart(false)` wipes `game[]`). |
| `gf_vis_*` (`vision`/`ambient`/`gridint`/`gridcon`/`hdr`/`fog`) | "" | RCON visual tweaks; client-side, unreliable on dedicated. |
| `gf_expbullets_radius` | 200 | RCON explosive-bullets blast radius. |

**Bridge telemetry** (dev-only, dedicated-only): `gf_cmd`, `gf_ack`, `gf_state`, `gf_roster`, `gf_say`.
**HUD** (per-client menu dvars): the `ui_gf_*` family (health panel, self bar, loadout overview,
lobby) — see `docs/REFERENCE.md`. **Dev/debug** (strip-wrapped): `gf_debug_spawns`, `gf_debug_hud_pool`,
`gf_debug_elem_probe`, `gf_hitch_pct`, `gf_hitch_debug`, `gf_force_loadout`, `gf_force_camo`.

**Friendly fire** is set via the **stock** tweakables `scr_team_fftype` + `scr_gf_team_fftype` by the
RCON panel — the mod GSC has **zero** FF references.

**Idle/AFK kicks are stock, not the mod** ([[stock-afk-and-spawn-kick-timers]]) — two independent
sub-5-minute timers, neither with a single `kick()` call in mod GSC. **`g_inactivity`** (input-idle kick,
**spectators included**) is owned by `dedicated.cfg`: the Plutonium `T5ServerConfig` template ships **190**
(kicks a quiet spectator at ~3 min), the VPS + our example now run **300**; the panel's ADVANCED tab edits
it live (cfg is boot-read). **`scr_kick_time`** (stock spawn-or-be-dropped) is *engine-registered at 60* and
armed whenever `level.rankedMatch` is true — which it **is** on our dedicated (`onlinegame 1` +
`xblive_privatematch 0`). It exempts `pers["team"] == "spectator"`, but would kick anyone the mod holds
team-assigned without spawning (a whole Auto/Manual lobby hold; a large-mode late joiner), so `gf.gsc`
pins it to **3600**.

**Connect/timeout drops are a separate axis from AFK — and are TWO dvars, not one**
([[sv-timeout-and-connecttimeout-template-defaults]]). Both measure *packet silence*, never input, and
both are **engine-registered** (no `gf.gsc` seed needed) and **not latched** (the panel's ADVANCED tab
changes them live).
- **`sv_timeout`** — an **already-in-game** client. The `T5ServerConfig` template ships **15**, which is
  hostile two ways: it drops anyone who alt-tabs out of **exclusive fullscreen** (Windows minimizes the
  window, the client stops pumping its main loop and stops sending — borderless/windowed keeps running
  unfocused and never hit it), and it makes the **server ~3× stricter than the client** (`cl_timeout` is
  **40**), so an ordinary lag spike drops a player who is still sitting there waiting. **Never set this
  below `cl_timeout` (40).** VPS + example now run **240** (the engine default). Raising it only costs the
  time a hard-crashed client keeps its player slot.
- **`sv_connectTimeout`** — a client still **connecting/loading**, i.e. the **first-join budget**. Engine
  default **80**, which is thin: a first-timer FastDL-downloads `mod.ff`, then the Plutonium client rebuilds
  its engine *in place* with no loading UI (D3D9 device destroyed + recreated, ~180MB of zones reloaded — a
  30-60s black screen, [[fastdl-first-join-black-screen-rebuild]]) and then runs a Demonware stats/CAC
  re-sync with documented multi-minute stalls. Blowing 80s mid-rebuild is much of why new players report
  having to **connect twice**. VPS + example now run **200** (matching the client's own `cl_connectTimeout`).
  It only ever applies before a client finishes loading, so raising it costs nothing.

**The Plutonium `g_fix_*` family — and why Gunfight ships 3 of 4 against the grain.** These are engine-level
bug fixes Plutonium added, and their **engine defaults split on one line**: a fix with **no gameplay
semantics ships ON**, a fix that **changes felt gameplay ships OFF**, so a stock server stays
vanilla-faithful — bugs and all. Gunfight opts into all of them, because a competitive gametype wants
*correct* damage and flinch, not bug-for-bug BO1 parity. ⚠ **Only 3 of the 4 names below are real dvars** —
`g_fix_viewkick_dupe` is a placebo. Registration and engine defaults come from a **live RCON read** (the
`Domain is …` + `default:` fields), NOT the `console_mp.log` dump: the dump cannot tell a registered dvar
from one our own cfg created ([[engine-dvar-defaults-from-log-dump]]).

| dvar | engine default | GF | what the bug is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `g_fix_damageKickReductionPerk` | **1** (on) | 1 (untouched) | Pure fix, already on. No cfg sets it and it still reports `Domain is 0 or 1`, so the family *exists* in MP. ⚠ That vouches for the family, **not for any individual name** — check each one's own domain. |
| `g_fix_entity_leaks` | **1** (on) | **1** | Engine entity leaks, incl. the `Hunk_AllocAlign failed on 8 bytes` leak from **weapon switching** — this mod's hot path (a fresh shared loadout every round, 24/7). ⚠ The **T5ServerConfig template sets this to 0**, actively *disabling* a fix the engine ships enabled. Restoring it is the one change here that is not a deviation. |
| `g_fix_viewkick_dupe` | **— (unregistered)** | 1 (**inert**) | ⚠ **NOT a real MP dvar.** Live read: `Domain is any text`, and `default:` merely mirrors the value our own cfg `set`. Setting it does nothing — there is no doubled flinch. Kept in cfg/panel only as a tripwire. |
| `g_fixBulletDamageDupe` | **0** (off) | **1** | A bullet through two **intersecting** players deals its damage **twice**. Corrupts three things GF is built on: score **is** cumulative damage dealt, a timed-out round is decided by **most remaining HP**, and rounds are **one life** (a doubled bullet = an unearned instant kill). Bodies overlap constantly in the tight 2v2 spawns. |

⚠ Note the **inconsistent naming** — three are `g_fix_snake_case`, one is `g_fixBulletDamageDupe`
(camelCase, no underscore). A `g_fix_` grep silently misses it. ⚠ All four are set in
`dedicated.cfg`, not seeded by GSC (three are real **engine** dvars; the fourth is inert); the panel
exposes them under ADVANCED → ENGINE GAMEPLAY. The VPS's
`dedicated.cfg` lives on the box and is **not** shipped by `deploy.ps1`, so a change here reaches the VPS
only via the panel (toggle live, then 💾 Save to persist) or a hand edit. ⚠ `g_print_entity_leaks 1` logs
leaks as they happen — the way to actually verify the entity-leak fix rather than assume it.

⚠ **Keep every `dedicated.cfg` comment semicolon-free** — the cfg parser splits on `;` *inside* a `//`
comment and executes each fragment ([[unknown-command-cd-and-cfg-semicolon-parse]]).

**Retired / inert dvars** (no longer read; a stale
cfg value does nothing): `scr_gf_largemode_minplayers`, `scr_gf_roster_wait`, `scr_gf_lobby_hold`/
`_restart`/`_restart_full`, `scr_gf_ff`/`scr_team_ff`, and the `bots_manage_*`/`bots_team_*` family as
Gunfight controls (still seeded for the vendored BotWarfare AI — don't delete the seeds; use `gf_fill_n`).

---

## Building mod.ff

`mod.ff` is a **gitignored build output** (registers the UI rows + strings + menus, compiles the custom
FX). **Pure GSC changes never need a rebuild** — edit + `map_restart`. Rebuild only when a *compiled*
asset changes: `mp/gametypesTable.csv`, `localizedstrings/gf.str`, `localizedstrings/cgame.str`,
`ui_mp/hud_gf.txt` or `ui_mp/hud_gf_health.menu` **structure** (dvar values/positions are
runtime-tunable), or a `raw/fx/misc/*.efx`.

### Overriding stock engine strings (`localizedstrings/cgame.str`)
A localizedstring baked into **our** `mod.ff` **overrides the game's own shipped-zone copy** — so any
single-purpose engine string can be retitled or blanked. ⚠ **The asset name is `<STR FILENAME>_<REFERENCE>`**,
so an engine `CGAME_*` string MUST be declared in a file literally named `cgame.str` (+ `localize,cgame`
in `mod.csv`); the same reference in `gf.str` compiles to `GF_*`, which nothing reads — a **silent no-op**.
An empty value renders as **nothing** (the engine does not fall back to printing the raw key). Currently
shipped: `SB_SCORE` → **"Damage"** (score in this mod IS cumulative damage dealt) and
`CONNECTIONINTERUPTED` → **""** (blanks the between-rounds banner — note the engine's own typo, one R).

The banner blank is the only lever on the *rendering*: `CG_DrawDisconnect` is client engine code and the
client has **no `cg_drawDisconnect` dvar** (verified against `BlackOpsMP.exe`), so GSC and the menu layer
can't reach it. It **hides** the banner; it does not remove the cause.
⚠ **It was never the "irreducible floor of `map_restart`", and treating it as one cost a lot of time.**
That framing is retired: `GF_ENDTL` measures `dark=0ms` (the server never goes snapshot-silent), and
`map_restart` runs *after* the killcam anyway, so it cannot land mid-replay. The plug people actually saw
was the **final-killcam timescale dilation starving the usercmd ack rate** — a real, fixable server-side
cause, now fixed by the slow-mo floor (see *Final-killcam slow motion*). Keep the blank as cosmetic cover
for genuine lag; do **not** cite it as evidence a symptom is unfixable.
([[killcam-slowmo-timescale-usercmd-backlog]], [[connection-interrupted-mitigations]])
⚠ It also suppresses the
warning for **genuine** lag/packet loss.
⚠ **Only the TEXT is gone — the PLUG ICON still renders, and cannot be removed.** It is material
`net_disconnect` → colorMap image `net` (Q3's inherited phone-jack); no dvar, and its position is hardcoded.
Overriding it would need a new image in `mod.ff`, and **this linker cannot embed one** — it writes an image
*reference* by name and silently drops the pixel data. Both attempts *built clean*: one was a no-op, the
other would have shipped a **missing-texture checkerboard** to every client. Tried and reverted
2026-07-12 → [[modff-cannot-embed-new-images]]. Do not retry without the Asset Manager/`.gdt` pipeline. ⚠ Keep overrides to single-purpose keys: the scoreboard's other
columns are `MPUI_*`, which the combat record / leaderboards / after-action report also use — renaming one
changes it **everywhere**. ⚠ Overrides only reach clients that downloaded `mod.ff`, i.e. players **already
on the server** — a messaging surface, never an ads/acquisition one. Full detail →
[[stock-engine-string-override-via-modff]].

**Always build via `tools/build_ff.ps1`** — it stages `mod.csv` to all five zone-source paths (the
linker reads the **assetlist** copy), stages the transitive `hud_gf_health.menu` explicitly, runs the
linker twice from `cwd=bin/`, cleans staged files back out of `raw/`, and copies `mod.ff` back. Never
call the linker by hand; step-by-step → `docs/DEV.md`. Key gotchas ([[build-stage-transitive-menu]]):
- **menufile double-load kills ALL gametypes.** A `.menu` pulled in by a `loadMenu` (like
  `hud_gf_health.menu` via `hud_gf.txt`) must NOT also be a `menufile` entry in `mod.csv` — double
  registration crashes the menu system and every gametype vanishes from the UI.
- **Empty `ui_mp/mod.txt` + `mod_ingame.txt` stubs** kill a ~4.6s "missing asset" mod-load stall (a
  first-join black-screen contributor — [[fastdl-first-join-black-screen-rebuild]]). Keep both.
- **GSC is deliberately NOT baked into `mod.ff`** — it loads as loose rawfiles; baking the unstripped
  `gf.gsc` once left a dangling dev `#include` that crashed FastDL clients. Never add `rawfile,*.gsc`.
- `build_ff.ps1` cleans `raw/` because Plutonium reads `raw/` as a fallback over IWDs even with no mod
  loaded — a leftover staged file silently overrides the stock game.
- `.efx` files must already live in `<GameRoot>\raw\fx\misc\`; the wrapper does not copy them. Expected
  harmless linker noise: GSC-rawfile errors and stock-FX image-missing errors.

## Release, deploy & secrets

**Branch model** ([[repo-release-branch-structure]]): `main` = full dev history + tooling (develop
here). **`release` is the GitHub default branch** — a fresh `git clone` lands there (minimal public
content), so `git checkout main` after cloning and push `main` with `tools/push_all.ps1`. *(The local
`origin/HEAD` may show `main` — that's a stale local ref; the actual GitHub default is `release`.)*

- **`package_release.ps1`** builds the public output (release branch = release zip, byte-identical):
  `mod.ff` + gameplay GSC + README. Dev files excluded by name; `// #strip-begin … #strip-end` regions
  removed, then comments stripped. ⚠ **Strip order is load-bearing** — markers before comments, or the
  dev body leaks (the marker lines are themselves comments; the wiring between them is real code).
  `tools/release_common.ps1` holds the shared drop-list + strip regex (one source of truth for the
  packager AND the verifier below).
- **The public build is a STRIPPED-DOWN Gunfight** — same *gameplay* as the VPS (rounds, shared
  rotating loadouts, overtime + capture zone, auto large/small team mode, curated spawns, damage
  scoring, menu HUD), **none of the dev/ops machinery**. Cut: the whole match-start hold
  (`gf_waitForLoadingClients` and everything it drives — load gate, min-players, Auto/Manual lobby +
  its camera/roster HUD, the team/bot plan transfer), the engine pregame warmup (the
  `g_pregame_enabled` seed is strip-marked — unseeded, the engine defaults it to 0 and BO1's own
  `_pregame` gametype can never come up, so there is **no `_pregame.gsc` to exclude**), bots, the RCON
  bridge, debug tooling, admin pause, the `gf_vis_*` r_* push, the RCON perk overrides, and the
  `level.maySpawn` hook (stock guards it with `isDefined`, so the public build installs none and falls
  through to stock grace/lives). The prematch **countdown stays** — pinned at a fixed 20s/7s, with the
  dvar-tunable version strip-marked behind it. A public server owner still gets the core knobs:
  `scr_gf_scorelimit` / `_timelimit(_large)` / `_overtimelimit(_large)` / `_roundswitch` /
  `_roundsperloadout` / `_teamspawnmode` / `gf_capture_time(_large)` / `scr_gf_flinch` /
  `scr_gf_jump_fatigue` / `scr_gf_sprint_unlimited` / `scr_team_maxsize`.
  ⚠ Two functions are deliberately kept OUTSIDE the strip regions because **live-round code still
  calls them**: `gf_anyTrackedClientLoading()` (called by `gf_roundWatchdog` + `gf_closeGraceEarly`;
  already returns false when the tracker never armed, so it degrades to "nobody is loading") and
  `gf_pushPauseBanner()` (called by `gf_runHealthHUD` every spawn; with `gf_matchPaused` never set it
  just clears the banner). The ~8 inert `isDefined( level.gf_inLobbyHold )` guards in
  `gf_playerSpawnedCB` / `_gf_loadouts` are likewise left in place — they degrade correctly and
  excising conditions from live `if` expressions is pure compile risk for zero behavior change.
- **`tools/verify_release_strip.ps1`** — **run after touching ANY strip region.** GSC resolves symbols
  at *compile* time, so a region that removes a function some KEPT code still calls is an `unknown
  function` that fails the **whole server**, and it won't surface until a client connects. The verifier
  applies the strip regions and statically proves: no kept call lands in stripped code, no kept
  `#include` points at a dropped file, and no dev-only dvar leaked. It does **not** prove the GSC
  parses — a real map load is still the final word.
- **`package_server.ps1`** builds the PRIVATE VPS bundle: the **entire `main` tree** + `mod.ff` +
  `dedicated.cfg`. ⚠ It does **not** strip — the VPS runs dev wiring live by design; only a hardcoded
  `rcon_password` in GSC is blocked ([[package-server-does-not-strip-markers]]).
- **`deploy.ps1`** runs **ON the VPS** as the server's own account (a wrong-account run silently mirrors
  to the wrong profile). `-Mod`: pulls `main`, checks `mod.ff` out of `origin/release` (gitignored on
  `main`), mirrors the tree + `mod.ff` into the mods folder, publishes `mod.ff` to the FastDL web root,
  restarts, and recycles the RCON panel + load-once box services. `-Web`: secret-scans + robocopy-mirrors
  `site/wwwroot` into IIS (preserving the box-owned `web.config`). ⚠ The restart auto-recovers a wedged
  `plutonium.exe -update-only` and drops a self-expiring watchdog-maintenance window
  ([[deploy-recycles-box-services]], [[deploy-restart-wedges-on-plutonium-updater]]).
  ⚠ `mod.ff` only reaches the box via `origin/release`, so committed menu/str/csv/FX changes are NOT
  live until rebuilt + republished ([[modff-drift-vs-gsc-deploy]]); verify a deploy via the two logs in
  the storage-path mod folder ([[vps-gsc-deploy-log-verification]]).

**Secrets** — three layers, no secret ever in a tracked file: (1) gitignored stores hold the values
(VPS `rcon_password`/`g_password` in `dedicated.cfg`; panel password in `secrets.local.json`; server key
in launch config); (2) `.gitignore`; (3) the tracked pre-commit hook `tools/hooks/pre-commit` (enable
once per clone: `git config core.hooksPath tools/hooks`). ⚠ `rcon_password` must be **≤23 chars**
(Plutonium truncates on login — [[rcon-tool-vps-connect-23char-cap]]). **The old leaked RCON password +
server key are in public git history and must be rotated once** — the layers only prevent future leaks.
Security runbook status → `docs/VPS_HARDENING.md`, [[gunfight-us-security-audit]].

## VPS & box services

The live server is a Contabo VPS ([[vps-server-provisioned]]); the launch bat + `sv_maxclients` latch
live only in `C:\gameserver\T5\start_mp_server.bat` ([[vps-launch-bat-and-maxclients-latch]]); the
in-game browser name comes from the Plutonium **server key label**, not `sv_hostname`
([[plutonium-serverkey-sets-browser-name]]). Box helpers are Scheduled Tasks (`register_services.ps1`):
`GF-RconPanel`, `GF-StatusService` (the single box-side RCON reader → writes the public `status.json` +
`activity.json` plus the `.secured`-gated `admin.json`/`health.json`, all atomically), `GF-ConnLogger`
(zero RCON — diffs `admin.json`), `GF-JoinNotify` (ntfy alerts), `GF-Watchdog` (short-lived, re-invoked
every 3 min so it can't exhaust a retry budget; restarts dead tasks, recovers wedges, `map_rotate`s a
stuck match).

**Muting a player (the owner's own connects).** `tools/ignore.local.json` (gitignored + `/XF`-excluded,
so it's box-local; shared loader `tools/ignore_list.ps1`, re-read on change with no restart) lists GUIDs
that are **excluded from activity, not from presence**. `GF-StatusService` filters them out of the
`recent` ring and the public `activity.json` **at the projection, never at the source** — `conn_logger`
still writes every connect to the `players_*.log` day-files, so the admin history stays complete and
un-muting restores the feed retroactively — while they stay in `status.json`'s live `players` list, so
the site's "who's on right now" remains truthful. `GF-JoinNotify` applies the same list *harder*: an
ignored player is treated as **not connected at all**, so they can't count toward "N online" or suppress
the high-priority "server now active" push when a real player joins.
⚠ **Panel-first rule: never add another direct RCON poller on the box** — all readers go through the
panel API on `127.0.0.1:3000`. The same rule now covers **geo**: the panel is the box's single ip-api
client (disk-cached `.geocache.json`, paced under the free tier's 45 req/min), and `/api/geoip?ips=`
is the cache-first, non-blocking batch read everything else uses. Player IP/GUID data reaches the web
only behind IIS Basic auth + the `.secured` interlock.

**Public connect history + country flags.** `activity.json` (public web root, **no** `.secured` gate) is
a 7-day connect/leave feed parsed from the same `players_*.log` day-files as the admin history, but
**PII-stripped**: time/name/event/session + a 2-letter country code, never an IP or GUID. status.html
renders it as a searchable feed and puts a flag next to each live player. Flags are **self-hosted SVGs**
(`site/wwwroot/assets/flags/`, vendored circle-flags) — emoji flags are NOT usable, they don't render on
Windows, and self-hosting keeps the CSP's `img-src 'self'` intact. ⚠ The feed inherits conn_logger's
chain (no `.secured` → no `admin.json` → no day-files → empty feed); status.js falls back to the live
in-memory `recent` ring in that case. Full runbook → `docs/VPS_DEPLOY.md`. Admin site + connection history →
[[gf-admin-connection-history]].

# T5 Engine Cheatsheet

> The load-bearing "how to write correct T5 GSC on this engine" reference. This is the **only**
> auto-loaded copy (`docs/REFERENCE.md` is scoped to *this mod's* code). Keep it inline.

## T5 GSC — critical API differences (confirmed-broken → correct)
| Broken in T5 mods | Correct T5 replacement |
|---|---|
| `getPlayers()` | `level.players` (engine array, always available) |
| `spawnStruct()` | Associative array: `s = []; s["key"] = val;` |
| `player isAlive()` / `isAlive(player)` | `player.health > 0` |
| `player.team` | `player.pers["team"]` → `"allies"`/`"axis"`/`"spectator"` |
| `level.onGiveLoadout = ::fn` | Does not exist. Loadout is delivered via `level.giveCustomLoadout` (called by `_class::giveLoadout`); lifecycle via `level.playerSpawnedCB`. |
| `player visionSetNaked(...)` | `visionSetNaked(...)` — a **bare** builtin in the MP VM (global to all clients); the method form throws unknown-function ([[vector-scale-in-common-scripts-utility]]). |

`setDvar("scr_player_healthregentime","0")` DOES work — set it before `_healthoverlay::init()` threads
and the engine disables regen itself.

**Compile-error diagnosis:** `unknown function: @ scripts/mp/<file>::<func>` means the broken call is
*inside* the named function — scan every call within it for (a) a T5-incompatible builtin, (b) a helper
in an un-`#include`d file, (c) a bare builtin called with a method prefix, or (d) **a function you
deleted from a stock script you override**. Causes (b)/(c) → [[vector-scale-in-common-scripts-utility]].

⚠ **(d) — overriding a stock script means keeping its ENTIRE public surface.** GSC resolves symbols at
**compile** time, so a stock caller links against your file *unconditionally* — even from inside a
runtime guard that would never be true. `_globallogic_ui::menuClass` does `if (isPregame()) self
maps\mp\gametypes\_pregame::OnPlayerClassChange(response);`, so shipping a `_pregame.gsc` without that
function fails the WHOLE server with `unknown function @ _globallogic_ui::menuclass` — naming the
caller, not the missing symbol. Before overriding any stock script, grep the raw dump for
`<scriptname>::` and keep every function you find, stubbed if unused.

## T5 engine reference

**Overridable engine/SD callbacks** (most set via `level.*` in `main()`): `playerSpawnedCB` (fires
`spawned_player`), `onSpawnPlayer`/`onSpawnPlayerUnified`, `onPlayerKilled`, `onPlayerDamage`,
`onDeadEvent(team)`, `onOneLeftEvent(team)`, `onTimeLimit`, `onRoundSwitch`, `onRoundEndGame` (returns
the match winner), `giveCustomLoadout`, `_setTeamScore`/`_getTeamScore`. Note `level.maySpawn` is set in
`onStartGameType` and **must be re-set every round** (map_restart wipes it); `spawnClient`/`spawnPlayer`
are engine defaults the mod does not override.

**Spawn pipeline (`spawnPlayer()` order):** (1) `setSpawnVariables` (origin/angles/team,
`sessionstate="playing"`); (2) `[[level.onSpawnPlayer]]()` selects the point and `self spawn(...)`;
(3) `[[level.playerSpawnedCB]]()` fires `spawned_player`; (4) `_class::setClass`; (5)
`_class::giveLoadout` → `[[level.giveCustomLoadout]]()` (our loadout is built here).

**Key state vars:** `game["state"]` (`playing`/`postgame`), `game["roundswon"][team]`,
`game["roundsplayed"]`, `game["switchedsides"]`, `level.gameEnded`, `level.inGracePeriod` (blocks
dead-event/forfeit), `level.inOvertime` (blocks all new spawns), `level.aliveCount[team]` /
`level.alivePlayers[team]` / `level.playerCount[team]`.

**Ending a round/game:** `sd::sd_endGame(winner, "")` (increments the winner's score, checks limits,
cycles the round / ends the match — no manual lives reset or `spawnClient` needed between rounds), or the
core `_globallogic::endGame(winner, reasonText)`. Score: `_setTeamScore(team, n)` / `_getTeamScore(team)`.

**Timer control:** `_globallogic_utils::pauseTimer()` / `resumeTimer()`. Score events (via
`_globallogic_score::givePlayerScore(event, player)`): `kill`, `headshot`, `assist`, `assist_25/50/75`,
`capture`, `defend`, `plant`, `defuse`, `melee_kill`, `hatchet_kill`, `other_kill`.

**Engine callbacks (`_callbacksetup.gsc`):** `CodeCallback_StartGameType`, `PlayerConnect`,
`PlayerDisconnect`, `PlayerDamage`, `PlayerKilled`, `ActorDamage`/`ActorKilled`, `VehicleDamage`,
`HostMigration`, `GlassSmash`.

**Critical gotchas:** `map_restart(true)` keeps `pers[]`/`game[]` and player positions but wipes all
`level.*` + entities; `false` wipes `pers[]`/`game[]` too (only dvars survive); threads survive both.
`updateTeamStatus()` runs `waittillframeend` → `level.aliveCount` can be one frame stale after a kill.
A **demo client is neither a human nor a bot** (`isdemoclient()` true, `istestclient()` **false**, no
`pers["isBot"]`, stock connect parks it teamless at `pers["team"] = ""`), so a bot filter must never be
written as the inverse of a humans-only filter — the real-bot test is `istestclient() && !isdemoclient()`.
`level.inGracePeriod=true` blocks forfeit/dead-event checks; `level.inOvertime=true` blocks new spawns.
`scr_disable_cac 1` auto-assigns `level.defaultClass="CLASS_ASSAULT"` and auto-spawns.

## T5 HUD system

**The per-client DRAWN render cap (the real limit).** T5 has TWO client-HUD limits and only the harmless
one is measurable: the **allocation pool** (`newClientHudElem` succeeds until ~900+ used) is NOT the
constraint; the **per-client DRAWN cap (~17-20)** is — beyond it, the last-created elements silently
don't render even though allocation succeeds and `.alpha`/`.x` read healthy. **No script probe can detect
it** (only the eye). It is **global across ALL hudelem types** (mod HUD + stock ammo/compass + score
popup + OT flag objpoint) and scales with lobby size, so a late-created element vanishes as the lobby
grows. **Mitigation: render mod HUD in the menu layer** (`ui_mp/hud_gf_health.menu`) — a separate system
with no such cap. Server pushes state via `setClientDvar` on change; itemDefs read it via `exp
rect X/Y`, `exp rect W`, `exp forecolor A`, `exp material(dvarString())`, `visible when(...)` (supports
`>`/`<=`/`&&`). Materials must be `material(dvarString())`, never a static `background` (the linker would
try to bundle the `.iwi`). Menu structure needs a `mod.ff` rebuild; dvar values don't. `setText` also
burns configstring slots that survive `map_restart`; use `setValue` for numbers and dvars for per-player
text ([[settext-configstring-exhaustion]]).

**Creation APIs (`_hud_util.gsc`):** `createFontString(font,scale)`, `createIcon(shader,w,h)`,
`createBar(color,w,h)`, `createPrimaryProgressBar()`, and server-side (all players, no per-player pool
slot) `createServerFontString(font,scale,team)`/`createServerIcon(...)`/`createServerBar(...)`. Fonts:
`default`, `bigfixed`, `smallfixed`, `objective`, `extrabig`. **Sizing:** `"default"` at `1.4` is the
reliable small-UI text combo; `fontScale` is a multiplier on the font's native raster, so `"bigfixed"`
at any scale ≤1.0 renders huge/aliased. For a **pulsing** element (score popup) set `baseFontScale`/
`maxFontScale`, not `.fontScale` (`fontPulse` resets to baseFontScale each frame —
[[script-hudelem-number-oversized]]). Server-side text always renders above client bars regardless of
sort.

**Transition helpers (on elements made with `createIcon`/`createBar`):** `transitionSlideIn(dur,dir)`,
`transitionSlideOut`, `hideElem`/`showElem`, `updateBar(frac)`, `setFlashFrac(frac)`.
**Element types:** `newHudElem` (server), `newClientHudElem` (client), `NewScoreHudElem` (score, a
separate pool from the ~17 cap). **Animation:** `fadeOverTime(t)` then set `.alpha`; `moveOverTime(t)`
then set `.x`/`.y`; `.glowColor`/`.glowAlpha`; `fontPulse(player)`. Standard live-element props:
`archived=false`, `hidewheninmenu=true`. Center-screen splashes: `_hud_message::oldNotifyMessage`
(native decode/typewriter FX, serialized, zero mod hudelems — use this, not `notifyMessage`, which needs
the broken `spawnStruct()`).

## T5 asset reference

**GiveWeapon:** `GiveWeapon(name)` or `GiveWeapon(name, dualWield /*bool*/)`. **T5 does NOT take a 3rd
camo arg like T6 in the 2-arg form** — camo goes through `CalcWeaponOptions` (below). Attachments are
baked into the name (`famas_reflex_mp`, `python_speed_mp`). Grenades AND equipment use `GiveWeapon`;
equipment also needs `SetActionSlot(1,"weapon",equip)`.

**Camo** — `camoOpts = int(self CalcWeaponOptions(camoIdx, lensIdx, reticleIdx, reticleColorIdx)); self
GiveWeapon(weapon, 0, camoOpts);`. Camo indices 0-15: 0 Default, 1 Dusty, 2 Ice, 3 Red, 4 OD Green,
5 Desert Nevada, 6 Desert Sahara, 7 Jungle ERDL, 8 Jungle Tiger, 9 Urban German, 10 Urban Warsaw,
11 Winter Siberia, 12 Winter Yukon, 13 Woodland, 14 Woodland Flora, 15 Gold. Pattern camos (5-14) don't
show on neutral-base weapons (python/knife/pistols/launchers). `crossbow_explosive` is the exception
(patterns + gold show). `custom_class["camo_num"]` is a dead end here (only affects the on-back model +
requires a CUSTOM class). Special primaries (minigun/m202/defaultweapon) reject camo — force index 0.

**Perks** (`SetPerk`/`hasPerk`/`UnSetPerk`). **A CAC perk is a `|`-delimited GROUP of `specialty_*`
tokens, and a Pro ability is just EXTRA tokens in that group** (`_class::validatePerkGroup` splits it,
`register_perks()` SetPerks each) — so GSC can grant any perk, any Pro, or a Pro *without* its base, à la
carte. The engine's 52 valid tokens + every base→Pro pairing (verified 3 ways: the token table in
`BlackOpsMP.exe`, `_properks.gsc` stat keys, and `shrp.gsc`'s shared `PERKS_<NAME>_PRO` groups) →
[[reference_t5_perks_and_pro_specialties]]. ⚠ `mp/statsTable.csv` (the real group table) is **not** in
`raw/` and is **not extractable** — its stringtable cells are stored as hashes; don't retry.
⚠ **`specialty_armorvest` is NOT Flak Jacket — and it is NOT any Black Ops perk** (it is none of the 15;
it's an engine **leftover** token with no create-a-class row and no icon, but with **live damage code**).
We call it **"Body Armor"**, named for its effect — do **not** give it a BO1-sounding name, that is how
`specialty_blindeye` survived. It applies a flat **−20% on every non-headshot BULLET hit**
(`_class::cac_modified_damage` → `damage * perk_armorVest * .01`, default 80), live via stock
`Callback_PlayerDamage`. Gunfight grants it to everyone **knowingly** (symmetric; a softer bullet TTK
suits a 42s round) — accept that headshots bypass it, so they are worth proportionally more and both
score (= damage dealt) and the most-HP-wins decision tilt toward them. Real Flak Jacket is
`specialty_flakjacket` (explosives; also granted); its Pro is `specialty_fireproof` (not granted).
**GF's base set (10, every spawn, `gf_giveCustomLoadout`):** `movefaster` + `fallheight` (Lightweight +
Pro), `longersprint` + `unlimitedsprint` (Marathon + Pro), `armorvest` (Body Armor, above), `flakjacket`
(Flak Jacket), `shades` + `stunprotection` (Tactical Mask Pro's two halves), `loudenemies` (Ninja Pro's
"enemies are louder" half), `fastmeleerecovery` (Steady Aim Pro's melee half — *"recovery rate after
lunging with knife is reduced"*). **Five Pros are granted without their base perk** — that's the
à-la-carte model, not an oversight. ⚠ **`fastmeleerecovery` needs NO dvar**: it gates
`perk_weapMeleeMultiplier`, whose *registered default 0.5 already halves recovery time* — the default **is**
the perk ([[perk-multiplier-defaults-are-the-effect]]). ⚠ **`bulletflinch` (Hardened Pro) is deliberately NOT here** — it is a second
flinch multiplier (0.2×) under `scr_gf_flinch` and belongs to the sniper/heavy package alone (see Flinch). `loudenemies` is the trick for
*globally louder footsteps*: it is **listener-side**, so granting it to everyone (and `quieter` to nobody)
makes everyone hear everyone else louder, symmetrically — there is no footstep-volume dvar in the engine
(`cg_footsteps` is a **client** dvar; `perk_footstepVolume*` does not exist).
⚠ `unlimitedsprint` and `loudenemies` are both **engine-consumed with zero GSC references** — they are the
two base perks whose effect is *unverified in-game*. If `unlimitedsprint` proves live, retire
`scr_gf_sprint_unlimited` / `player_sprintUnlimited` entirely.

**Per-loadout perks** — `gf_load()`'s optional 8th field: a comma-separated specialty list layered on the
base set, `-token` to remove one. Parsed once at pool build, applied after the base set and before the
RCON override layer (so admin toggles still win). **Only 3 reach the HUD** (the overview has 3 perk
icons): base perks are preferred over Pros and **the same icon is never used twice** — a Pro has no art of
its own and borrows its parent's, so a perk beside its own Pro would render one icon twice. Today: 43
loadouts run the base set alone; the 8 snipers + M202 + Minigun carry the **sniper/heavy package** (9
perks: Hardened + **Hardened Pro's flinch half**, Steady Aim + both Pros, Scout + Pro, Sleight of Hand +
Pro), which displays as Hardened / Steady Aim / Scout. `specialty_bulletflinch` rides **here and nowhere
else** — it is the 0.2× `perk_damageKickReduction` gate, so these 10 loadouts take ~½ the flinch everyone
else does (and it costs no HUD slot: its icon parent, Hardened, is already shown). The **8 snipers additionally drop Body Armor** (`-specialty_armorvest`), so
they take **full** non-headshot bullet damage — they out-range you, so they don't also out-tank you. The
**M202 and Minigun keep it** and stay heavy tanks; that asymmetry is deliberate. Edit it all in
`tools/loadout_editor` (checkbox grid + one-click package); its save-time validator rejects any token the
engine doesn't know.
Common: `specialty_movefaster` (Lightweight) + `specialty_fallheight` (its Pro), `specialty_longersprint`
(Marathon) + `specialty_unlimitedsprint` (its Pro), `specialty_fastreload` (SoH) + `specialty_fastads` (its Pro),
`specialty_gpsjammer` (Ghost), `specialty_bulletpenetration` (Hardened) + `specialty_bulletflinch` (its
Pro — reduced flinch when shot), `specialty_quieter` (Ninja), `specialty_gas_mask` (Tactical Mask) +
`specialty_shades`/`specialty_stunprotection` (its Pro — flash/stun resist), `specialty_holdbreath`
(Scout) + `specialty_fastweaponswitch` (its Pro), `specialty_bulletaccuracy` (Steady Aim),
`specialty_scavenger`, `specialty_twoattach` (Warlord) + `specialty_twogrenades` (its Pro).

**HUD shaders** — weapons default to `"menu_mp_weapons_" + base` (base = no `_mp`, no variant suffix).
Special cases: `ithaca_grip→…ithaca`, `stoner63→…stoner63a`, `crossbow_explosive→…crossbow`,
`minigun_wager→…minigun`, `python_speed→…python`, `m1911→…colt`, `makarov→…makarov`, `cz75→…cz75`.
Lethals: `frag_grenade→hud_grenadeicon`, `satchel_charge_mp→hud_icon_satchelcharge`,
`sticky_grenade→hud_icon_sticky_grenade`, `hatchet→hud_hatchet`. Tacticals use a `hud_us_` prefix:
`flash→hud_us_flashgrenade`, `concussion→hud_us_stungrenade`, `smoke→hud_us_smokegrenade`
(Gas→`hud_icon_tabun_gasgrenade`, Decoy→`hud_nightingale`). Precache in the precache phase
(`PreCacheShader`). Named shaders usable directly: `progress_bar_bg/fill/fg`, `score_bar_bg/allies/opfor`,
`waypoint_*` / `compass_waypoint_*` (`capture`/`defend`/`captureneutral`), `white`, `black`,
`hud_death_suicide` (the skull the health panel + Finger-Gun reuse).

**Audio:** `self playLocalSound(alias)`, `_utility::playSoundOnPlayers(alias, team)`,
`play_sound_in_space(alias, origin)`. `_globallogic_audio::leaderDialog(key[, team])` keys:
`gametype`, `last_one`, `halftime`, `round_success`/`round_failure`, `winning`/`losing`, `timesup`,
`challenge` (set the alias via `game["dialog"][key]`). Music:
`_globallogic_audio::set_music_on_team(state, team)` (`MP_LAST_STAND`, `TIME_OUT`, `SILENT`, …);
`actionMusicSet("state")`.

**Classes/menus:** `level.defaultClass="CLASS_ASSAULT"`; classes `CLASS_ASSAULT`/`SMG`/`CQB`/`LMG`/
`SNIPER`, `CLASS_CUSTOM1..10`. Menu names live in `game["menu_*"]`.

**Useful dvars:** `compass 0/1`, `compassSize`, `cg_fov`, `bg_gravity`, `scr_game_prematchperiod`. Full
weapon-name list + attachment variants → [[reference_t5_mp_weapons]]; the "oldschool/reset" dvar set
(jump/mantle/fall-damage/sprint resets) is documented there rather than pasted here.

## T5 spawn system, game objects, loadout delivery, player utilities

**Spawn points:** `_spawnlogic::getSpawnpointArray(classname)`, `getSpawnpoint_Random(points)`,
`getSpawnpoint_NearTeam(points)`, `getRandomIntermissionPoint()`. SD classnames: `mp_sd_spawn_attacker`
(allies) / `mp_sd_spawn_defender` (axis); TDM start: `mp_tdm_spawn_<team>_start`. Bias with
`_spawning::addSpawnInfluencer(origin,radius,weight,type,teamMask)` / `addSphereInfluencer`.

**Game objects (OT zone):** `zone = _gameobjects::createUseObject(ownerTeam, trigger, visuals, offset)`;
then `allowUse("friendly"|"enemy"|"any"|"none")`, `setUseTime(s)`, `setUseText(&"str")`,
`setVisibleTeam("any")`, `set2DIcon`/`set3DIcon`, `setOwnerTeam(team)`. On a `trigger_radius` the engine
runs the **proximity** think (standing accrues capture, no button). `zone.onUse` fires on capture-complete;
`getOwnerTeam()` reads the owner. Simpler waypoint: `objective_add(id,"active",origin)` +
`objective_icon(id,shader)` + `objective_state`/`_setvisibletoplayer`/`_delete`.

**Loadout delivery:** inside `giveCustomLoadout`, `_wager::setupBlankRandomPlayer(takeAll, chooseBody)`
clears the player, then `GiveWeapon`/`switchToWeapon`/`giveMaxAmmo`/`setWeaponAmmoClip`/`SetPerk`/
`SetActionSlot`. Delay grenades a few seconds after spawn to prevent spawn-instant throws.

**Player utilities:** `freezeControls(0/1)`, `DisableWeaponCycling`/`EnableWeaponCycling`,
`setSpawnWeapon`, `closePopupMenu`/`closeIngameMenu`/`closemenus`, `printBoldOnTeam(text, team)`.
Button polls (in a `wait 0.05` loop): `AttackButtonPressed`, `UseButtonPressed`, `MeleeButtonPressed`,
`AdsButtonPressed`, `JumpButtonPressed`, `FragButtonPressed`, `ActionSlotOneButtonPressed`, …
Strings: `strTok(str, delim)`, `getSubStr(str, start, end)`. Arrays: `quickSort(arr)`. Dynamic dispatch:
`self [[ fnArray[i] ]]()`. Prefer `notify`/`waittill` state machines over polling flags. Scoreboard:
`setscoreboardcolumns(...)` (`kills`/`deaths`/`assists`/`captures`/`headshots`/…). FX: `id = loadfx(path)`
then `spawnFx(id, origin)` / `triggerFx(id)` (⚠ handles are `level.*` → re-load after `map_restart`).
`trigger_off()` blocks players only — a hardcoded engine notify passes through it; divert it by repointing
the level var at a dummy `script_origin` ([[trigger-off-vs-script-notify]]).
